$NetBSD$

Installation done. To finish the setup, type:

	freevo setup

at the command prompt. freevo will perform then package checking, which
looks like this:

	checking for mplayer...    /usr/pkg/bin/mplayer
	checking for mencoder...   not found (deactivated)
	checking for tvtime...     not found (deactivated)
	[...]

You can of course install additional packages to increase freevo
functionality.

Have fun!
