- broken dependency from www/py-beautifulsoup

- fix python's ossaudiodev to support netbsd

- nearly all the pkg-options (except for mame and snes groups) are used for
  viewing or recording TV.  Maybe they should all be combined into one
  option "tv" ?

- port Lirc (Linux infrared remote control) to netbsd, make a package,
  then make a package for py-lirc and then add dependency to freevo.

- Most of the patches were removed.  Most of them simply changed the check
  for the python version.  It works fine on my box without the patches.
  Is that a freebsd thing?

  Specificly:
  original maintainer had replaced all instances of 
            sys.version[0:3]
  with
            sys.version[0:3].replace("p", ".")

  However, I find that sys.version[0:3] returns a perfectly formed "2.3"
  does the "p" show up often?

- Lots of testing to do.  Dunno what is up with dotz's error, below, but
  it may be fixed by now in FreeBSD.

- I think some of freevo's device support will need fixing for netbsd.
  (remote control, game pad, etc)

E-mail:

and ask for NetBSD (pkgsrc) package placement at:
	http://freevo.sourceforge.net/install.html
_when_ it works. No earlier.

Current crash reason: pygame draw module not available (on fbsd at least)
