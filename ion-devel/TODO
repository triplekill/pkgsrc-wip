I'm not entirely satisfied with the fact that the package
installs a system.mk file that references buildlink dir.
That's fine when plugins are installed from pkgsrc, but
not for plugins that are not built from pkgsrc. The
reference should be set to $(X11BASE) (and hard wired in
the installed system.mk file).
