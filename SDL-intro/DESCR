Simple DirectMedia Layer introduction.

This package does not contain anything by itself -- it is a
"meta-package" that depends on other SDL-intro packages.
Its sole purpose is to require dependencies so users can install
this package only and have all the SDL-intro stuff pulled in by
the port/package dependency mechanism.
