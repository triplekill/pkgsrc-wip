Serious:
- Guess why the overlay mode does not work, at least on NetBSD...

- Add `xawtv' to the list of packages which support the USE_MMX variable in
  bsd.pkg.defaults.mk when importing it.

Misc:
- Maybe write a more complete DESCR file -- half done.

- I think, that this application will have different bin/* set when compiled
  on Linux, than on BSDs (fbctl -- webpage and DESCR mention it)
  
  Someone with linux should have a look at it
  
- do we want to build the motif viewer? I personally don't (Motif seems
  to be a living dead now) -- anyway, the app supports it.

- manpages installed in ${PREFIX}/man/es and ${PREFIX}/man/fr:
	- do such paths comply with filesystem standards?
	- do we want to have it installed?
	
  I have commented out @dirrm lines in PLIST, that removed
  man/es and man/fr hierarchy.
