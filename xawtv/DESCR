xawtv is a set of utilities to manage the video4linux interface (and BSD's
bktr driver too).  The main component of the suite is xawtv itself, which
is a X11 application to watch the TV.

What exactly is in the xawtv package...
* xawtv of course, it is still the main application. A nice X11 application
  for watching TV. 
* v4lctl, a command line tool to set video4linux parameters (tune in some
  channel, set TV norm, ...). 
* streamer, a command line tool for capturing still images and avi-videos
  (with sound). 
* radio, a simple, curses-based radio app. 
* webcam, captures images and uploads them with FTP to a Web-Server in a
  endless loop. 

xawtv, fbtv and v4lctl share the same config file. 

Not available in NetBSD package:
* motv a new, IMHO better, motif-based GUI for xawtv.
* fbtv is a TV application for the linux console, it uses the new 2.2.x
  framebuffer devices. 
* alevtd, a http server for videotext pages. VBI decoder taken from Edgar
  Toernig' alevt application.
