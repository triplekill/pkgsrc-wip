Please note that the only way the Tor Project recommends browsing the
web through Tor is the Tor Browser, which is currently not packaged in
pkgsrc.  See <https://www.torproject.org/projects/torbrowser.html.en>.

Other applications can be torified with the help of libtsocks (net/tsocks).
A tsocks configuration file for this is installed as
${PREFIX}/share/examples/tor/tor-tsocks.conf.
