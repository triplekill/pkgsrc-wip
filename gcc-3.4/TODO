- Need to address bootstrapping without existing Ada pkg.

- Need to address architectures other than NetBSD with native pthreads.

- Building from an instance of this package, installed in a non-standard
  location does not work

- The sequence: make && make deinstall && make install does not work
  because the installation uses on the Ada compiler tools used to
  build the pkg. It should be possible to use the new tools in the
  installation.

- Requires fix to lang/gcc3-ada PR pkg/24573 to build. As part of this
  fix, a buildlink3.mk file was provided for lang/gcc3-ada 

- With the latest snapshot, make test is broken because the gcc scripts
  depend on an installed tool from gcc 3.4. The tests can be be run with
  some manipulation of the environment to select gnatls from gcc 3.4.
