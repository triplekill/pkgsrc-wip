* Cocoa support is broken due to patch-ab, force to not self-contained
  exec_prefix and libexecdir, but emacs/Makefile.in does not honor it.
* GNUStep support is not tested.
* --disable-font-backend was deprecated, default behaviour.
* gnome option should be gone away.
   * dbus option should be added
   * librsvg is gnome-free now, and can use with Cocoa.
