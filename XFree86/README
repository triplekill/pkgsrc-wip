These packages try to stay away from any software that is available
elsewhere in pkgsrc. So we avoid the included fontconfig, freetype2,
and expat. We realize that this may lead to rebuilding XFree86
more than desired (when fontconfig is updated, for instance) but we
believe that this is the best way to do things.

Before trying to install this meta-package, you will need to do
a few things:

* x11-links tries to detect if we have ${X11BASE} created and checks
  if we have the X headers. You will have to create your X11BASE
  directory, and comment these lines from pkgtools/x11-links/Makefile:

  $ sudo mkdir -p /usr/X11R6/bin
  $ sudo mkdir /usr/X11R6/lib
  $ sudo chmod 770 -R /usr/X11R6 ( if you are on the group wheel )

  #.if !exists(${X11BASE}/include/X11/X.h)
  #PKG_FAIL_REASON= "${PKGNAME} requires X headers to be installed"
  #.endif

* You will need to add the XFree86-libs buildlink to your bsd.pkg.mk,
  when the XFree86 has been instaled or if any package requires the
  headers of X, i.e:

  .if defined(USE_X11)
  X11_LDFLAGS=            # empty
  X11_LDFLAGS+=           -Wl,${RPATH_FLAG}${X11BASE}/lib
  X11_LDFLAGS+=           -L${X11BASE}/lib
  LDFLAGS+=               ${X11_LDFLAGS}
  .include "../../wip/XFree86-libs/buildlink2.mk"
    .endif
  .endif

After making these changes, you shouldn't have any problems.
Good luck!
