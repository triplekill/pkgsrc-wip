These packages try to stay away from any software that is available
elsewhere in pkgsrc. So we don't use the included fontconfig, freetype2,
and expat. We realize that this may lead to rebuilding XFree86
more than desired (when fontconfig is updated, for instance) but we
believe that this is the best way to do things.

Before trying to install this meta-package, you will need to do
a few things:

* You will not be able to install these packages if ${X11BASE} does
  not exist. To work around this you could just create the directory
  yourself, but for a more automated solution, find the block

  .  if defined(USE_X11) && !exists(${X11BASE})
  PKG_FAIL_REASON+= "${PKGNAME} uses X11, but ${X11BASE} not found"
  .  endif

  in bsd.pkg.mk, delete the PKG_FAIL_REASON line, and replace it with

  @${MKDIR} ${X11BASE}
  @${CHOWN} ${ROOT_USER}:${ROOT_GROUP} ${X11BASE}
  @${CHMOD} ${PKGDIRMODE} ${X11BASE}

  Note that those need to have a tab character in front of them.

* x11-links checks if we have the X headers, so you will have to
  comment out the following lines from pkgtools/x11-links/Makefile:

  #.if !exists(${X11BASE}/include/X11/X.h)
  #PKG_FAIL_REASON= "${PKGNAME} requires X headers to be installed"
  #.endif

* You will need to reinstall the x11-links package when the XFree86
  package has been installed succesfully.

After making these changes, you shouldn't have any (infrastructure)
problems.

Good luck!

This meta package has been tested and reported that works
perfectly on:

	* FreeBSD 5.1-CURRENT ( x86 )
	* NetBSD 1.6U -current ( x86 )
	* Debian sid with gcc-3.3.1 ( x86 )
