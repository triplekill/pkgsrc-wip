Note: I have tested this package only with NetBSD-current.
      Cannot say anything about NetBSD 1.6.x branch.

Todo:
  * Test test and once again test..
  * Add rc.d scripts.
  * Fix Python detection scheme to be more flexible.
  * Make package with OpenSSL.
  * Send NetBSD specific patches to the authors.
  * Build/test on other platforms and architectures
