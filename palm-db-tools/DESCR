This is an early development version of a set of tools for converting
between various flat file formats and several common Palm OS database
files. Currently it creates two tools:

csv2pdb - Convert a comma separated values text file to a Palm DB file
pdb2csv - Convert a Palm DB file to a comma separated values text file

No man page for these tools yet, but a text description is installed
in ${LOCALBASE}/share/palm-db-tools/manual.txt
