Clustal X is an X windows interface for the ClustalW multiple sequence 
alignment program. It provides an integrated environment for performing 
multiple sequence and profile alignments and analysing the results. The 
sequence alignment is displayed in a window on the screen. It also provides 
a versatile coloring scheme which has been incorporated to allow one to 
highlight conserved features in the alignment. The pull-down menus at the 
top of the window allow you to select all the options required for 
traditional multiple sequence and profile alignment.
