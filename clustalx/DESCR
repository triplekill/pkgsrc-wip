Clustal X is a new windows interface for the ClustalW multiple
sequence alignment program.  It provides an integrated environment for
performing multiple sequence and profile alignments and analysing the
results.  The sequence alignment is displayed in a window on the
screen.  A versatile coloring scheme has been incorporated allowing
you to highlight conserved features in the alignment.  The pull-down
menus at the top of the window allow you to select all the options
required for traditional multiple sequence and profile alignment.

You can cut-and-paste sequences to change the order of the alignment;
you can select a subset of sequences to be aligned; you can select a
sub-range of the alignment to be realigned and inserted back into the
original alignment.

Alignment quality analysis can be performed and low-scoring segments
or exceptional residues can be highlighted.

ClustalX is available for a number of different platforms including:
SUN Solaris, IRIX5.3 on Silicon Graphics, Digital UNIX on DECStations,
Microsoft Windows (32 bit) for PC's, Linux ELF for x86 PC's and
Macintosh PowerMac.
