The open source Calendar and Contacts Server project is a
standards-compliant server implementing the CalDAV and CardDAV
protocols. It provides a shared location on the network allowing
multiple users to store and edit calendaring and contact information.

CalDAV is an Internet standard allowing a client to access scheduling
information on a remote server. It extends the WebDAV (an HTTP-based
protocol for data manipulation) specification and uses the iCalendar
format for the data. The protocol is defined by RFC 4791. It allows
multiple clients access to the same information thus allowing
cooperative planning and information sharing. Many server and client
applications support the protocol.

CardDAV is an address book client/server protocol designed to allow
users to access and share contact data on a server. The CardDAV
protocol is defined by RFC 6352.
