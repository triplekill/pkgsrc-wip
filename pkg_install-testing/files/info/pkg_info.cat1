     The ppkkgg__iinnffoo command is used to dump out information for packages, which
     may be either packed up in files or already installed on the system with
     the pkg_create(1) command.

     The _p_k_g_-_n_a_m_e may be the name of an installed package (with our without
     version), a pattern matching several installed packages (see the _P_A_C_K_A_G_E
     _W_I_L_D_C_A_R_D_S section for a description of possible patterns), the pathname
     to a binary package, a filename belonging to an installed package (if --FF
     is also given), or a URL to an ftp-available package.

     The following command-line options are supported:

     --aa      Show information for all currently installed packages.

     --BB      Show some of the important definitions used when building the bi-
             nary package (the "Build information") for each package.

     --bb      Show the NetBSD RCS Id strings from the files used in the con-
             struction of the binary package (the "Build version") for each
             package.  These files are the package Makefile, any patch files,
             any checksum files, and the packing list file.

     --cc      Show the one-line comment field for each package.

     --DD      Show the install-message file (if any) for each package.

     --dd      Show the long-description field for each package.

     --ee _p_k_g_-_n_a_m_e
             This option allows you to test for the existence of a given pack-
             age.  If the package identified by _p_k_g_-_n_a_m_e is currently in-
             stalled, return code is 0, otherwise 1.  The names of any pack-
             age(s) found installed are printed to stdout unless turned off
             using the --qq option.  _p_k_g_-_n_a_m_e can contain wildcards, see the
             _P_A_C_K_A_G_E _W_I_L_D_C_A_R_D_S section below.

     --FF      Interpret any pkg-name given as filename, and translate it to a
             package name using the Package Database.  This can be used to
             query information on a per-file basis, e.g. in conjunction with
             the --ee flag to find out which package a file belongs to.

     --ff      Show the packing list instructions for each package.

     --II      Show the index entry for each package.

     --ii      Show the install script (if any) for each package.

     --KK _p_k_g___d_b_d_i_r
             Set _p_k_g___d_b_d_i_r as the package database directory.  If this option
             isn't specified, then the package database directory is taken
             from the value of the environment variable PKG_DBDIR if it's set,
             otherwise it defaults to _/_v_a_r_/_d_b_/_p_k_g.

     --kk      Show the de-install script (if any) for each package.

     --LL      Show the files within each package.  This is different from just
             viewing the packing list, since full pathnames for everything are
             generated.

     --ll _s_t_r  Prefix each information category header (see --qq) shown with _s_t_r.
             This is primarily of use to front-end programs that want to re-
             quest a lot of different information fields at once for a pack-
             age, but don't necessary want the output intermingled in such a
             way that they can't organize it.  This lets you add a special to-
             ken to the start of each field.

     --mm      Show the mtree file (if any) for each package.

     --NN      Show which packages each package was built with (exact dependen-
             cies), if any.

     --nn      Show which packages each package needs (depends upon), if any.

     --pp      Show the installation prefix for each package.

     --qq      Be ``quiet'' in emitting report headers and such, just dump the
             raw info (basically, assume a non-human reading).

     --RR      Show which packages are required by each package.

     --rr      Show the requirements script (if any) for each package.

     --SS      Show the size of this package and all the packages it requires,
             in bytes.

     --ss      Show the size of this package in bytes.  The size is calculated
             by adding up the size of each file of the package.

     --VV      Print version number and exit.

     --vv      Turn on verbose output.

     Package info is either extracted from package files named on the command
     line, or from already installed package information in _/_v_a_r_/_d_b_/_p_k_g_/_<_p_k_g_-
     _n_a_m_e_>.

     A filename can be given instead of a (installed) package name to query
     information on the package this file belongs to.  This filename is then
     resolved to a package name using the Package Database.  For this transla-
     tion to take place, the --FF flag must be given.  The filename must be ab-
     solute, compare the output of pkg_info --aaFF.

PPAACCKKAAGGEE WWIILLDDCCAARRDDSS
     In the places where a package name/version is expected, e.g. for the --ee
     switch, several forms can be used.  Either use a package name with or
     without version, or specify a package wildcard that gets matched against
     all installed packages.

     Package wildcards use fnmatch(3).  In addition, csh(1) style {,} alter-
     nates have also been implemented.  Package version numbers can also be
     matched in a relational manner using the _>_=, _<_=, _>, and _< operators.  For
     example, _p_k_g___i_n_f_o _-_e _'_n_a_m_e_>_=_1_._3_' will match versions 1.3 and later of the
     _n_a_m_e package.  The collating sequence of the various package version num-
     bers is unusual, but strives to be consistent.  The magic string ``al-
     pha'' equates to _a_l_p_h_a _v_e_r_s_i_o_n and sorts before a beta version.  The mag-
     ic string ``beta'' equates to _b_e_t_a _v_e_r_s_i_o_n and sorts before a release
     candidate.  The magic string ``rc'' equates to _r_e_l_e_a_s_e _c_a_n_d_i_d_a_t_e and
     sorts before a release.  For example, _n_a_m_e_-_1_._3_r_c_3 will sort before
     _n_a_m_e_-_1_._3 and after _n_a_m_e_-_1_._2_._9 Similarly _n_a_m_e_-_1_._3_a_l_p_h_a_2 will sort before
     _n_a_m_e_-_1_._3_b_e_t_a_1 and they both sort before _n_a_m_e_-_1_._3_r_c_1 In addition, alpha-
     betic characters sort in the same place as their numeric counterparts, so
     that _n_a_m_e_-_1_._2_e has the same sorting value as _n_a_m_e_-_1_._2_._5 The magic string
     ``pl'' equates to a _p_a_t_c_h _l_e_v_e_l and has the same value as a dot in the
     dewey-decimal ordering schemes.

     PKG_DBDIR  If the --KK flag isn't given, then PKG_DBDIR is the location of
                the package database directory.  The default package database
                directory is _/_v_a_r_/_d_b_/_p_k_g.

     PKG_PATH   This can be used to specify a semicolon-separated list of
                paths and URLs to search for package files.  If PKG_PATH is
                used, the suffix _._t_g_z is automatically appended to the _p_k_g_-
                _n_a_m_e, whereas searching in the current directory uses _p_k_g_-_n_a_m_e
                literally.

     PKG_TMPDIR, TMPDIR
                These are tried in turn (if set) as candidate directories in
                which to create a ``staging area'' for any files extracted by
                ppkkgg__iinnffoo from package files.  If neither PKG_TMPDIR nor TMPDIR
                yields a suitable scratch directory, _/_v_a_r_/_t_m_p, _/_t_m_p, and
                _/_u_s_r_/_t_m_p are tried in turn.  Note that _/_u_s_r_/_t_m_p may be creat-
                ed, if it doesn't already exist.

                Since ppkkgg__iinnffoo requires very little information to be extract-
                ed from any package files examined, it is unlikely that these
                environment variables would ever need to be used to work
                around limited available space in the default locations.
