This is a PostgreSQL contrib package. It extends basic PostgreSQL server
functionality, but may be not available everywhere.

uniqueidentifier:
This data type is a 16-byte uniqueidentifier widely used to unique identify
entities across Universe. This implementation depends on libuuid from
e2fsprogs package (http://e2fsprogs.sourceforge.net) by Theodore Ts'o. I
don't know is it possible to build e2fsprogs not on Linux, but seems libuuid
itself is fairly portable. So it may be possible to cut libuuid from
e2fsprogs and compile it alone.
