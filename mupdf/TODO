Notes on updating mupdf to mupdf-1.3 (a not-so-a-TODO)
======================================================

o mupdf-1.3 depends on openjpeg-2.0 (previously mupdf-1.1 depended on
  openjpeg-1.5). ${WRKSRC}/Makerules is not correct and still looks for
  openjpeg-1.5 so patches/patch-ab was modified in order to fix this
  behaviour. Please also note the SUBST.makerules class in Makefile.
o mupdf should be build with "build=release" (the default is "build=debug" and
  that may be indesiderable for the common user).
o In order to completely disable the building of third party libraries (it is
  better to use the ones provided/handled by pkgsrc) a brutal ${RM} -fr completely
  remove the ${WRKSRC}/thirdparty directory. For more information please read
  ${WRKSRC}/Makethird.
o ${WRKSRC}/docs/thirdparty.txt may help for adding correct version of the
  dependencies.


What should be done before importing to print/mupdf? (and now the TODO!)
========================================================================
o mupdf binary should be installed as "mupdf" not as "mupdf-x11"...
o buildlink3.mk and files/mupdf.pc may need to be updated and reviewed.
o dependencies of mupdf (if there are any) NOT tested. If some package depends
  on mupdf it should be tested too.
o More cleanup... I have just two eyeballs and maybe I have missed something
  around. Please test and improve the package!
o NOCURL and V8_PRESENT options should go to options.mk. Actually IMHO it's
  better to only add the curl support. v8 seems that is only in pkgsrc-wip.
  However, adding an options.mk is the last *and* least step before importing
  it to print/mupdf.
