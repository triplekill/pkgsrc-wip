Notes on updating mupdf to mupdf-1.3 (a not-so-a-TODO)
======================================================

o mupdf-1.3 depends on openjpeg-2.0 (previously mupdf-1.1 depended on
  openjpeg-1.5). ${WRKSRC}/Makerules is not correct and still looks for
  openjpeg-1.5 so patches/patch-ab was modified in order to fix this
  behaviour. Please also note the SUBST.makerules class in Makefile.
o mupdf should be build with "build=release" (the default is "build=debug" and
  that may be indesiderable for the common user).
o In order to completely disable the building of third party libraries (it is
  better to use the ones provided/handled by pkgsrc) a brutal ${RM} -fr completely
  remove the ${WRKSRC}/thirdparty directory. For more information please read
  ${WRKSRC}/Makethird and the post-extract target in Makefile.
o ${WRKSRC}/docs/thirdparty.txt may help for adding correct version of the
  dependencies.
o To add libcurl support (www/curl) patches/patch-Makethird was introduced and
  patches/patch-ab was modified in order to use pkg-config for
  $(SYS_CURL_CFLAGS) and $(SYS_CURL_LIBS).
o By default now mupdf install different binaries, e.g. mupdf-x11 (previous it
  was just "mupdf"), mupdf-x11-curl, etc.. In pkgsrc we install *only* the
  featureful version of mupdf simply as "mupdf". For more information please
  give a look to patches/patch-ac.
