CherryPy is a pythonic, object-oriented web development framework
It provides the foundation over which complex web-based applications
can be written, with little or no knowledge of the underlying protocols
CherryPy allows developers to build web applications
in much the same way they would build any other object-oriented Python
program. This usually results in smaller source code developed in less time
