I'm working on a ACID pkg at the moment and it will need this pkg as
a dependency.

Need to check the license.

Not really tested on NetBSD 1.6 i386.

Give it a go and let me know if there are any problems.

Ta,

Adrian.


XXX this is a php-lib file (no php binary module). Should it still be
	renamed to php-jpgraph? - hubertf
