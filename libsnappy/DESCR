Snappy is a compression/decompression library. It does not aim for
maximum compression, or compatibility with any other compression
library; instead, it aims for very high speeds and reasonable
compression. For instance, compared to the fastest mode of zlib,
Snappy is an order of magnitude faster for most inputs, but the
resulting compressed files are anywhere from 20% to 100% bigger.
On a single core of a Core i7 processor in 64-bit mode, Snappy
compresses at about 250 MB/sec or more and decompresses at about
500 MB/sec or more.

Snappy is widely used inside Google, in everything from BigTable
and MapReduce to our internal RPC systems. (Snappy has previously
been referred to as "Zippy" in some presentations and the likes.)

For more information, please see the README. Benchmarks against a
few other compression libraries (zlib, LZO, LZF, FastLZ, and QuickLZ)
are included in the source code distribution.
