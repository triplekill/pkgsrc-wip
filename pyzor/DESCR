Pyzor is a collaborative, networked system to detect and block spam
using identifying digests of messages.

Pyzor initially started out to be merely a Python implementation of Razor,
but due to the protocol and the fact that Razor's server is not Open Source
or software libre, I decided to impelement Pyzor with a new protocol and
release the entire system as Open Source and software libre.

Since the entire system is released under the GPL,
people are free to host their own independent servers.
Server peering is planned for a future release.
