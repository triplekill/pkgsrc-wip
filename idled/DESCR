Idled (pronounced idle-dee) is a program that will run
in the background on a machine and monitor the current
tty sessions. It can be configured to log out users that
have been idle for too long or logged on for too long.
It can also prevent users from being logged in too many
times, and refuse users from being logged in at all.
