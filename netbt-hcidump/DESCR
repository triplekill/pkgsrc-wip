HCIdump reads raw HCI data coming from and going to a Bluetooth device and
prints to screen commands, events and data in a human-readable form.
Optionally, the dump can be written to a file rather than parsed, and the dump
file can be parsed in a subsequent moment.

This is a patched standalone version not requiring bluez-libs, suitable
for the netbt bluetooth stack used by NetBSD.
