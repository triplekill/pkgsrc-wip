BOUML is a free UML tool box (under development) allowing you to specify and
generate code in C++, Java and Idl. It runs under Unix/Linux/Solaris, MacOS X,
and Windows.

BOUML is very fast and doesn't need a lot of memory to manage several thousands
of classes, see benchmark.

BOUML is extensible, and the external tools (I name them plug-outs) may be
developed in C++ or Java (not in Visual Basic, enjoy !), using BOUML for their
definition as any other program. The code generators and reverses are ones of
the pre-defined plug-outs included in the BOUML distribution. See features.

Does not work with QT4.  QT3 must be installed with the -no-xft option because
QT3 in the pkgsrc system has been configured to depend on Xft2.  When QT3 opens
a font, the font size is wrong, and this message is given to the console:
"couldn't open fontconfigs chosen font with Xft!!!"  Until the relationship
between QT3, fontconfigs, and Xft2 is resolved, use the -no-xft option.
