Works when tested by itself and with gpgsm, however,
it does not work reliably with Kmail for SMIME.

This package is designed to work with PTH threads. The
PTH option is currently disabled because the gpgme test
of gpgsm hangs when PTH threads are enabled. I'm
modifying gpg-agent to work with the threads package
detected by pthreads.mk.
