TODO
====

1) On NetBSD a working cabsl function must be present in libm to build gfortran.
This has been added to -current on 2014/10/10 and to NetBSD7 on 2014/10/13. Before this date it was defined in complex.h but missing from libm in current and 7. 
2) I have only tested building and bmake test on NetBSD current amd64.

3) This package and the lang/gcc4x need a cleanup or a complete new start. I
think that SUBST_VARS could handle the platform dependencies in a much cleaner
way.

4) There are many undocumented hacks in the Makefile and patches. And yes, I
am guilty ;-) 

 

Have fun,

Kai-Uwe
