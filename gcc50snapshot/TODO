TODO
====

1) On NetBSD a working cabsl function must be present in libm to build gfortran.
This has been added to -current on 2014/10/10 and to NetBSD7 on 2014/10/13. For
older systems the cabsl.c from NetBSD7 could be backported in gcc50snapshot, but
in my opinion the broken cabsl in NetBSD6 should be replaced (it is defined in
complex.h but missing from libm).

2) This package and the lang/gcc4x need a cleanup or a complete new start. I
think that SUBST_VARS could handle the platform dependencies in a much cleaner
 way.

3) There are many undocumented hacks in the Makefile and patches. And yes, I
am guilty ;-) 

4) I have not tested building and bmake test on systems besides NetBSD current.
 

Have fun,

Kai-Uwe
