    Done:
	+   Test publishing with MS-FrontPage 2000 (part of Office 2000)
	    Target Platform was NetBSD/alpha 1.6.1.
	+   A patch adding setre[ug]id(2) in the OSF1 compatibility
	    module has been submitted.  GNATS id port-alpha/21870.
	+   Updated MESSAGE with a list of directives needed, and 
	    required values.

    To-do:
	+   write a manual page on owsadm.exe.  The average NetBSD
	    administrator shouldn't even think about using fpinstall.sh,
	    as it gets a number of things wrong (they are right on
	    OSF1/Tru64, but not on NetBSD.)

    Items in need of attention:
	+   Testing on non-alpha platforms (intel and sparc*)
	+   ?much? sanity checking
	+   test more than just owsadm.exe.

    Notes:
	To operate on NetBSD/alpha 1.6.*, (and probably earlier) a small
	patch needs to be applied to sys/compat/osf1/syscalls.master, to
	add support for setre[ug]id(2).  Fortunately, NetBSD already has
	these calls, so it was easy to add support.

	Additional system calls may require emulation once executables
	other than owsadm.exe have been tried. [no other system calls
	were needed to run shtml.exe or author.exe]
