    Items in need of attention:
	+   Testing on non-alpha platforms (intel and sparc*)
	+   ?much? sanity checking
	+   test more than just owsadm.exe.

    Notes:
	To operate on NetBSD/alpha 1.6.*, (and probably earlier) a small
	patch needs to be applied to sys/compat/osf1/syscalls.master, to
	add support for setre[ug]id(2).  Fortunately, NetBSD already has
	these calls, so it was easy to add support.

	A patch request will be submitted to -current.

	Additional system calls may require emulation once executables
	other than owsadm.exc have been tried.
