lldpd (0.7.7)
  * Features:
    + Use a locally administered MAC address or an arbitrary one
      instead of null MAC address for bond devices on Linux. This is
      configurable through `lldpcli`.
    + Add support for "team" driver (alternative to bond devices).
    + Preliminary support for DTrace/systemtap.
    + Preliminary support for seccomp (for monitor process).
    + Setup chroot inside lldpd instead of relying on init script.
  * Fixes:
    + Various bugs related to fixed point number handling (for
      coordinates in LLDP-MED)
    + Fix a regression in how MAC address of an enslaved device is
      retrieved.
