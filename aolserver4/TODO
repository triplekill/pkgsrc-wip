This package does not build.

- ${WRKSRC}/include/Makefile.global has a variable named TCL_CC that 
  seems to be undefined so when a "module" tries to build, there is 
  no compiler in the command line.  

- Even after kludging that, there seems to be a thread library 
  conflict.  I have pth installed, but even then, I thought it
  was all supposed to Just Work now.

- There are undoubtedly tons of mistakes here, but I want to get
  it out there so someone smarter than me can work on it.
