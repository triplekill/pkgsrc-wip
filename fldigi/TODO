- fltk or fltk13 issue
  3.21.59 needs fltk 1.3
  3.21.60 is dual compatible. Can be packaged with
    either one of fltk13 and fltk (1.1)
  Check all the cases.                
   (1) No PKG_OPTIONS.fldigi             OK
   (2)    PKG_OPTIONS.fldigi= fltk13     OK
                                     options 
                                     fltk13   -
   (3) fltk   is already installed   
   (4) fltk13 is already installed   

  The first attempt for 
  alreay-installed test is done by having two lines in limited_list
  of pbulk, may be bad test (?). 
  Needs meta-pkgs just with fldigi and fltk (?)

- add options to mk/defaults/options.description
          
- portaudio  is needed ? (See INSTALL and configure results), probably yes
  [gdt think pulseaudio is normal, and portaudio is atypical, so it's best
  not to link portaudio, unless some pkgsrc/fldigi user explains why]
  [It is not working with my environment, but it is harmless and may not
   be the reason to remove for that (mef)]
