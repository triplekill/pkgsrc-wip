   ham/fldigi (3.03) segfaults on NetBSD/amd64 6_BETA2
   while this package runs fine there.

- portaudio  is needed ? (See INSTALL and configure results), probably yes
  [gdt think pulseaudio is normal, and portaudio is atypical, so it's best
  not to link portaudio, unless some pkgsrc/fldigi user explains why]
  [It is not working with my environment, but it is harmless and may not
   be the reason to remove for that (mef)]
- WRKREF issue
- patches/patch-a? in ham/ is really unnecessary ?
  patch-aa:
  Type issue of argument of ioctl. Upstream fixed (with little bit
  different edit), it is OK to remove.

    Also add some patches to remove use of deprecated symbols and fix other
    problems when looking for or compiling against libpng-1.4.x.
    ----
  libpng-1.4 transition was old story, it is OK to remove.

    Cast via ssize_t to make GCC happy. This is still somewhat abusive, but
    easier than to switch to dynamically allocated int.

  Upstream fixed (with little bit different edit), it is OK to remove.
