- DragonFly may give (remote) xorg X server to restart (protocol error ?)

- portaudio  is needed ? (See INSTALL and configure results), probably yes
  [gdt think pulseaudio is normal, and portaudio is atypical, so it's best
  not to link portaudio, unless some pkgsrc/fldigi user explains why]
  [It is not working with my environment, but it is harmless and may not
   be the reason to remove for that (mef)]
- WRKREF issue
