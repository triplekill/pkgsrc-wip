Does it compile on NetBSD-stable and NetBSD-current?

Does it need perl5?

USE_GNU_LIBICONV in Makefile -- perhaps should show like a configureable
option during a build for systems which allow such kind of selection.

USE_GNU_LIBICONV -- which values should be set for NetBSD-stable and
NetBSD-current?

"docs" doesn't compile on FreeBSD-STABLE and is hashed out by
patches/patch-aa in Makefile.in . IMVHO docs should be an optional, extra
package so I don't think this is an error -- they are available via gtk.org
in HTML format.
 
PLIST -- is it complete? Please verify it.

Should we include gettext-lib buildlink unconditionally in buildlink2.mk or
push GLIB_USE_GNU_ICONV to Makefile.common and then depend on this setting
in buildlink2.mk?

Could it be patched so it doesn't conflict with devel/glib2 ?
