You need automake version 1.7 to build.  1.4 won't work!
Autoconf 2.57 is also required to build.

The automake version of the cinelerra source tree needs third-party libraries
development files installed. Run 'autoreconf -i' to create configure and
supporting files.

        <x86 CPUs only>
You probably want to enable MMX support.  To do that, run ./configure with
the --enable-mmx option.  NB! If you do that, you may have to use the
--without-pic option, too.  Otherwise, compilation can fail.

and see the README.BUILD

old version:
edit build/Makefile.cinelerra and/or cinelerra/Makefile
to not use libraries here but to use pkgsrc
