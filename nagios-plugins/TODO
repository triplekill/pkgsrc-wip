TODO file for nagios-plugins:
	- I think there is a problem with the mailq check.
	- There is a problem with the sensors check.
	- Testing, glorious testing. Yes I want some more...
	- There are a couple of checks which use other pkgs. We may want
to either included a dependancy or create another nagios-plugin-XXX pkg.
I have not looked at the checks that aren't compiled/installed.
