RetroArch is a multi-system emulator for Linux, Windows, Mac OS X and *BSD. It
is formerly known as SSNES.

Its design and background is quite different than most other emulators as
RetroArch does not implement an emulation core itself. RetroArch talks to
libretro, a generic emulator core API. This means that RetroArch is core
agnostic, and it does not care which emulator core is running.

Currently there are libretro implementations for systems such as SNES, NES, GBA,
GB/GBC, Genesis, and even arcade games (Final Burn Alpha).

libretro isn't only usable for emulators. A preliminary port of an open source
reimplementation of Cave Story has been ported to libretro as well.

RetroArch believes in modularity. The application itself is a command-line
driven application suitable for HTPC and/or headless use. There also exists a
GUI frontend for RetroArch, supporting every single config option available in
RetroArch.
