Rlab is an interactive, interpreted scientific programming environment.
Rlab is a very high level language intended to provide fast prototyping and
program development, as well as easy data-visualization, and processing.
Rlab is not a clone of languages such as those used by tools like Matlab or
Matrix-X/Xmath. However, as Rlab focuses on creating a good experimental
environment (or laboratory) in which to do matrix math, it can be called
``Matlab-like''; since the programming language possesses similar operators
and concepts.
