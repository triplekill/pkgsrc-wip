This package is a collection of XMMS Skins that were created by
several people all around the world.

This package does not contain anything by itself -- it is a
"meta-package" that depends on other packages.  Its sole purpose is to
require dependencies so users can install this package only and have
all the other packages pulled in by the port/package dependency
mechanism.
