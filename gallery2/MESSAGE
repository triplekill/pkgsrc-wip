$NetBSD$

gallery2 is now installed in the ${G2DIR} directory,
and gallery2's data directory is ${G2DATA}.

To get the final installation & setup instructions, go to the gallery2
documentation homepage:

	http://codex.gallery2.org/Category:Gallery_2:Installation

And don't forget to read the security information regarding gallery2:

I've included ZwahlenDesign's NetBSD footer logos
(see http://www.netbsd.org/gallery/other-logos.html)
and put those in the gallery2 images directory.

I've also added some *NetBSD-patch files to use for getting a netbsd logo
in the footer. Those must be applied _after_ the web part of the setup of
gallery2 is finished. (otherwise gallery2 will complain during the
installation process about source files being tampered with...)

# cd ${G2DIR}
# patch < GalleryTemplateAdapter.class.NetBSD-patch
# patch < ALL.theme.tpl.NetBSD-patch
