$NetBSD$

This application uses gnome icons.  If you plan to run groku within KDE,
you may want to add the following line to one of the gtkrc files in the
search path (e.g., ~user/.gtkrc.mine):

gtk-fallback-icon-theme="gnome"

Without specifying gnome as the fallback icon theme, some of the icons
will be missing.
