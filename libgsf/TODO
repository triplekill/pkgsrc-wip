maybe:
--with-html-dir=${PREFIX}/share/doc/gsf --disable-gtk-doc --with-gnome

I wonder if I need USE_LIBTOOL???

make sure docs are installed

either force this to always disable or always enable:
checking for
    libbonobo-2.0 >= 2.0.0
    gnome-vfs-2.0 >= 1.9.16
    ... Package libbonobo-2.0 was not found in the pkg-config search path.
Perhaps you should add the directory containing `libbonobo-2.0.pc'
to the PKG_CONFIG_PATH environment variable
No package 'libbonobo-2.0' found
configure: WARNING: GNOME support disabled, unable to find required version of V
FS and/or Bonobo
