GoogleSharing is a special kind of anonymizing proxy service, designed
for a very specific threat. It ultimately aims to provide a level of
anonymity that will prevent Google from tracking your searches,
movements, and what websites you visit. GoogleSharing is not a full
proxy service designed to anonymize all your traffic, but rather
something designed exclusively for your communication with Google. The
system is totally transparent, with no special "alternative" websites
to visit. Your normal work flow should be exactly the same.

After installation, run googleshare -h for help.

To use this proxy, you need the GoogleSharing Firefox add-on from
<http://www.googlesharing.net/download.html>.
