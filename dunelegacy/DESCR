Dune Legacy is an effort by a handful of developers to revitalize
the first-ever real-time strategy game.

It tries to be as similar as possible to the original gameplay but
to integrate user interface features most modern realtime-strategy
games have like selecting multiple units.

Featues:
 * Open source and cross platform
 * Modern display resolutions
 * Modern RTS controls like selecting multiple units and right-click
   commands
 * Original campaign with Harkonnen, Atreides and Ordos
 * Super Dune campaign with Fremen, Sardaukar and Mercenary
 * Multiplayer support
 * Map editor
