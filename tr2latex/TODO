todo: restricted because of "no profit is made by copying the files"
see README

The download servers archive this on the fly.
Probably should make a tarball for this.
Different ctan servers send slightly different files and
checksum can't be used and since there are various
ctan servers one could give compromised files.
And some of the mirrors don't tar it up.
Also tar ball has windows executable?

todo: maybe patch Makefile.unix for CC and CFLAGS not overwritten
