This module is used to calculate leap seconds for a given Rata Die
day. It is mostly intended for use by the DateTime.pm, rather than
for external users.

This library uses 1 second precision and is known to be accurate
for dates until december 2003.

There are no leap seconds before 1972, because that's the year
this system was implemented.
