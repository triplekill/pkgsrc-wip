Dragbox is a tool for connecting the command line with the desktop environment. It 
summons a drag handle in a window when you are managing files or text in the shell, 
connecting the different workspaces -- desktop and command line. 

Dragbox can take items on the command line or from a pipe and put on its shelf.
The inverse is also possible: dragged-to items can be output to the shell
