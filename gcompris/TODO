PLIST doesn't have sounds

It hangs a lot -- I was told it was from libgnomecanvas issues.

It doesn't figure out locale correctly by default -- so installed
sounds aren't used.  (Workaround is to symlink or copy ogg files
from /usr/pkg/share/gcompris/boards/sounds/en/ to
/usr/pkg/share/gcompris/boards/sounds/.)

It has problem with tar --exclude when extracting some files.
(Easy fix.)

This version has a known bug where it repeatedly loops when doing
boards/music/background ogg file.

PLIST needs
@exec install-info
@unexec install-info --delete
