ONLY_FOR_PLATFORM perhaps (no BSDs!), PLIST, make it build, perhaps add
patches:
http://www.sleepycat.com/webforms/patchdl.php?src=patch.1.86.2
http://www.sleepycat.com/webforms/patchdl.php?src=patch.1.86.3
http://www.sleepycat.com/webforms/patchdl.php?src=patch.1.86.4

... and 1.86.1 patch is for irix 5.x, but I don't have a machine to test it.
