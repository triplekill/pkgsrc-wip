The Heirloom Documentation Tools provide troff, nroff, and relat-
ed  utilities to format manual pages and other documents for out-
put on terminals and printers.  They are  portable  and  enhanced
versions of the utilities released by Sun as part of OpenSolaris,
and, for pic, grap, mpm, and some minor parts, by Lucent as  part
of Plan 9.
