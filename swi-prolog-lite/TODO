Makefile: CPPFLAGS -D__unix__=1 -- will that be correct on Interix or Cygnus
or other win32?

	-- dotz@irc.pl


The pkg works now, but some cleanup may be in order:
 * gmake is hardcoded in a few places, as configure doesn't properly
   set MAKE=gmake. The pkg doesn't build with BSD make.
 * passing of include and library paths (both -L and -Wl,-R as well as 
   via LD_RUN_PATH in at least two places) should be reviewed
 * The Cpp symbol "__unix__" isn't passed on properly into all places,
   even as it's both set via the pkgsrc CPPFLAGS variable and also (via
   a patch) in src/pl-incl.h. Most affected file is unx/process.c as  
   it will still compile, but miss a few symbols that are much needed
   for the xpce shared object file. Error shows up at runtime only. 
   (The file "shlib.pl" included in the pkg was provided kindly by the
   SWI-Prolog maintainer Jan Wielemaker to give better error messages).
