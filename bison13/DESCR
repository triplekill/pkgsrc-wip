Bison is the GNU replacement for yacc(1).  Some programs depend on
extensions present in Bison.

[WARNING]
This is old version of GNU Bison, needed to compile some packages, imported
as a need for backward compatibility. If you plan to use GNU Bison, get a
recent version of the package from devel/bison.
