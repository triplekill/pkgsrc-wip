The program gst123 is designed to be a more flexible command line
player in the spirit of ogg123 and mpg123, based on gstreamer. It
plays all file formats gstreamer understands, so if you have a
music collection which contains different file formats, like flac,
ogg and mp3, you can use gst123 to play all your music files.

Since gst123-0.1.0 support for watching videos has been added;
however gst123 should run fine in situations where no X11 display
is available; videos can be played without X11 display, too (-x,
--novideo); in this case, only the audio stream will be played.

It is implemented in C++ and licensed under the GNU LGPL version 2.
