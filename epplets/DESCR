Epplets are small, handy Enlightenment applets, similar to "dockapps"
or "applets" for other packages.  The epplets package contains the
base epplet API library and header files, as well as the core set of
epplets, including CPU monitors, clocks, a mail checker, mixers, a
slideshow, a URL grabber, a panel-like toolbar, and more.
