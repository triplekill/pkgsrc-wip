Enlightenment DR16 is a window manager for the X Window System that is designed
to be powerful, extensible, configurable and pretty darned good looking!  It is
one of the more graphically intense window managers.

Enlightenment  goes beyond managing windows by providing a useful and appealing
graphical shell from which to work.  It is open in design and instead of
dictating a policy, allows the user to define their own policy, down to every
last detail.

DR16 itself is still in active development which runs independently on
Enlightenment E17 and reached the 1.0 milestone in 2009 (1.0.14 as of 2014).
