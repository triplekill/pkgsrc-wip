From pflkm homepage <http://foo.unix.se/joelw/pflkm.html> :

The OpenBSD packet filter (or pf, for short) replaced Darren Reed's IP Filter
in OpenBSD 3.0, due to problems with IP Filter's license. Since then, pf has 
evolved quickly, and now has several advantages over IP Filter.

Here is a port of the pf code found in OpenBSD 3.3 to NetBSD 1.6.1.  In my
opinion, the biggest advantage is the integration with ALTQ, a QoS framework
for various packet scheduling algorithms, but there's also work on adding
support for things like stateful failover between pf firewalls. Considering
how much work is being done on pf, the advantages over IP Filter will only
increase.

Therefore, I believe NetBSD will eventually want to integrate pf into NetBSD.
Until then, you can use this loadable kernel module to get pf going, although
it unfortunately does not support ALTQ (that would require many changes to the
kernel, not possible for a mere LKM).

So why isn't it already in NetBSD-current? Well, core@netbsd.org is of the
opinion that pf is not yet mature enough, so they decided to leave it out (at
least that's what they thought in January, 2003). I will update this LKM once
for every OpenBSD release, until they change their mind, and I also hope to
create a set of patches against NetBSD-current with full support for IPv6 and
ALTQ.
