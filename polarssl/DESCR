PolarSSL is an SSL library written in ANSI C. PolarSSL makes it easy for
developers to include cryptographic and SSL/TLS capabilities in their
(embedded) products with as little hassle as possible. It is designed to be
readable, documented, tested, loosely coupled and portable.

This package includes headers/libs only, not the demo programs.
