LAM/MPI is an implementation of the Message
Passing Interface (MPI) parallel standard that is
especially friendly to clusters. It includes a
persistent runtime environment for parallel
programs, support for all of MPI-1, and a good
chunk of MPI-2, such as all of the dynamic
functions, one-way communication, C++ bindings,
and MPI-IO.
