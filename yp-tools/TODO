Maybe this package should be named linux-yp-tools.
But the other yp* packages are said to work on different platforms.
So test under other operating systems?

has conflicts with net-tools: 
 bin/domainname
 bin/nisdomainname
 bin/ypdomainname
With net-tools this is the same as hostname(1) via symlink.
And hostname is already provided with coreutils.
So maybe make net-tools not install hostname, etc.

Do not install man pages to share/man, but man.
