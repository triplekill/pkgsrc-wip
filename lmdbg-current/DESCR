LMDBG is a collection of small tools for collecting and analyzing logs
of malloc/realloc/memalign/free etc. function calls. Unlike many
others, LMDBG does not provide any way to detect overruns of the
boundaries of malloc() memory allocations, as this is not the
goal. Like most other malloc debuggers, LMDBG allows detecting memory
leaks. Unlike some others LMDBG generates full stacktraces and
separates the logging process from analysis, thus allowing you to
analyze application on a per-module basis. Simple but powerful tools
for analisis are also provided.

lmdbg-run    - Creates malloc/realloc/free/memalign/... logs
lmdbg-sym    - Converts addresses to 'file.c:NUM func_name'
lmdbg-leak   - Checks for memory leaks
lmdbg-stat   - Gathers statistical information about memory allocations
lmdbg-grep   - Greps the stackframes
lmdbg-strip  - Strips the stackframes
lmdbg-module - Enrichs the stackframes with a module name
lmdbg-sort   - Sorts the stackframes by e.g. total allocated bytes,
               a number of memory allocations etc.
lmdbg-sysleaks - Filters out system memory leaks e.g. libc's
