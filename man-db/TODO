Jul 29 Vade 79             (7611) man-db[] multiple(4) vulnerabilities

It would be nice to have some pkgsrc-wide VARDIR (or VARBASE)
then use it for setting MAN_DB_CAT_DIR.

The config file should use settings used in install, like
MAN_DB_CAT_DIR.

MESSAGE mentions recreating cache indexes. Maybe this should be done
via INSTALL script?

MESSAGE did have:
  su ${MAN_DB_USER} -c "${LOCALBASE}/bin/mandb -c"
but this needs a shell (Linux su has no -m)
should I have a shell or who cares?

bin/mandb -c can be done by any user. Should it really be setuid man-db?

This needs to be patched to support .0 suffix in preformatted cat files;
I already discussed with developer.

does this matter?

need to test different tools this provides

maybe databases/db buildlink could be used instead of db3
I patched my db3 so it would provide db_185 compat
I have also used with gdbm

man.1 = $(DESTDIR)$(manroot)/$(nlspath)/$(man1dir)/$(man)$(man1ext)
GNU/./man1/man.1

man < 1.5l has vulnerability -- make sure this doesn't have same
 I couldn't repeat it

make sure it reads the installed etc/man_db.conf

ask tech-pkg about MANDB_MAP

define a pager PAGER and BROWSER

if not netbsd, then depend on groff

--with-db=LIBRARY       use database library LIBRARY
                          (db3, db2, db1, db, gdbm, ndbm)
  --with-config-file=CF   use config file CF [CF=SYSCONFDIR/man_db.conf]
  --with-libiconv-prefix=DIR  search for libiconv in DIR/include and DIR/lib
