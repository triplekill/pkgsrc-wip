Check if things need to be done for the POSIX Pthread check. GCC now warns it
is assuming non-POSIX pthread implementation.

Also, see what is going on with the readline, and why the patches are necessary.
I don't have any readline knowledge, so I'd be grateful if someone would take
a look at it.

Somehow, it can't find pthread.h on an old system with external libpth.
No idea what causes this.
