.Dt REPLACE-COMMONBUMP 1
.Os
.Sh NAME
.Nm replace-commonbump
.Nd tool to help expanding (replacing) commonbump file to the real list of Makefile's.
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm
.Op Fl a
.Op Fl h
.Op Fl p Ar pkgsrcdir
.Op Fl T Ar list_file
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm
is a perl script for pkgsrc developers. It simplifies the process expanding
`commonbump' file into `commonbump-replace'. Commonbump file is to be created by the first stage of revbump process, as is described in revbump(1).
.Pp
.Nm Fl h
displays a short usage.
.Pp
If
.Fl p
is given,
.Ar pkgsrcdir
is used instead of the default
.Pa /usr/pkgsrc .
.Pp
If
.Fl a
is given,
check all pkgsrc tree, disregard neither to
.Fl T
option nor to the default `commonbump' file.
It will check if "# used by" is included or not, usually in Makefile.common in the package.
.Pp
If
.Fl T
is given,
.Ar list_file
is used instead of the default
.Pa `commonbump' .
.Pp
.Nm
prints the package name
(in
.Ar category/package
form) on stdout for each package where it failed, but usually none.

The internal process is divided into three stages.

.item
(1)
Read entire pkgsrc tree and check a
.Ar referer -> referenced
relation,
then internally keeps (opposite)
.Ar referenced -> referer
relation table.

.item
(2) Read a file, named `commonbump' or the other name given with -T, which
usually lists Makefile.common or *common.mk files to be expanded.

.item
(3) Now expands the filename listed in `commonbump' into the list of packagename/Makefile by
referenced -> referer relation. It then outputs to the file
`commonbump.replaced' (currently the name is fixed).
