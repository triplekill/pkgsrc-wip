Note For Users Upgrading From SpamAssassin 2.5x
-----------------------------------------------

Due to the database library change, and the change to the database format
itself, you will want to do something like this when upgrading:

- stop running spamassassin/spamd (ie: you don't want it to be running
  during the upgrade)
- run "sa-learn --rebuild", this will sync your journal.  if you skip this
  step, any data from the journal will be lost when the DB is upgraded.
- install DB_File module if necessary
- upgrade SA to 2.6x
- if you were using another database module previously, run
  "sa-learn --import" to migrate the data into new DB_File files
- run "sa-learn --rebuild", this will cause the db format to be upgraded.
  if you want to make sure everything runs correctly, you can add the "-D"
  option.
- test the new database by running some sample mails through SpamAssassin,
  and/or at least running "sa-learn --dump" to make sure the data looks
  valid.
- start running spamassassin/spamd again

More information can be found in the man pages for 'spamassassin',
'sa-learn', 'spamc' and 'spamd', with 'perldoc Mail::SpamAssassin::Conf'
and in
