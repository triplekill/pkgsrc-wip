SA 2.6x uses a new format for the Bayes database. *Before* deinstalling
SA 2.5x, make sure you ran 'sa-learn --rebuild' for every Bayes database.

If you're running Razor please use at least p5-razor-agents-2.22nb2
which contains some fixes from the SpamAssassin team to improve behaviour
in Perl taint mode.

Some configuration options were changed (see Mail::SpamAssassin::Conf).
Please check that your existing mail configuration still works.

More information can be found in the man pages for 'spamassassin',
'sa-learn', 'spamc' and 'spamd', with 'perldoc Mail::SpamAssassin::Conf'
and in

        ${PREFIX}/share/doc/spamassassin/
