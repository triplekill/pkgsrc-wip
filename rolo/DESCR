Rolo keeps track of your contacts and displays them to you with a
text-based menu. Rolo strives to be a well-constructed tool for
complimenting text-based email programs-such as mutt. It utilizes the
vCard version 3.0 format for storing its contacts and it interfaces with
the end-user through an ncurses front-end.

Currently, you must edit the vCard data by hand; to help you, RFC2426,
which documents the vCard format is provided in ${PREFIX}/share/doc/rolo.
