1)
	Boost seems to like to put docs into the same directory mixed in with
	other stuff in ${WRKSRC}/lib/somelib/

	Some docs in Boost are in ${WRKSRC}/doc/html

	A find on extention + copy to share/docs/boost/html needs to be added

2) 
	There is a man page archive that can be downloaded separatly for
	some libs.
