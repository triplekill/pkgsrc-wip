This tool is to be used to mesure different kinds of streams, the idea is to
create a good source to get concepts and resources for other tools that mesure
system usage.

You can mesure how KB/s grows a file received by FTP or NetCat for example.
How fast processes eat memory, stream usage (pipe like), etc.
