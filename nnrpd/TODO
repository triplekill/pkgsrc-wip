# INN 1.7 nnrpd pkg issues

- Make sure we got all the relevant patches from 
  http://www.mibsoftware.com/userkt/inn/patches/

- To obtain PERL_LDOPTS, we need to run Perl - but at that point we
don't know if we actually have it?!

- Should we try to keep clear of INN heritage (/var/news etc.) to
allow installing INN and C News at the same time?

- Fix rc.d script installation
