You will need to customize the following files to configure ejabberd for
local use:

    ${PKG_SYSCONFDIR}/ejabberd.cfg

Note: this package includes an unofficial patch to support multiples listeners
on the same port number, which enables IPv4 and IPv6 concurrently.

Quick start for ejabberd:
	ejabberdctl start
