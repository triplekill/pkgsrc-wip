XCache is a fast, stable PHP opcode cacher that has been proven and is now
running on production servers under high load. It is tested (on linux) and
supported on all of the PHP release branches, such as PHP_5_1, PHP_5_2,
PHP_5_3, PHP_5_4 and PHP_5_5. ThreadSafe/Windows is also perfectly supported.
XCache overcomes many of the problems found with other opcachers such as
being able to run with new PHP versions.
