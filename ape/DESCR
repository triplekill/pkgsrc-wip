APE is a programmer's editor, designed to function as a complete
programming environment for Unix.  APE users can easily code,
compile and test from within the editor, rather than repeatedly
typing complicated Unix commands at the shell prompt.  APE provides
a convenient interface to many of the standard programming tools,
including compilers, debuggers, on-line manuals, etc.  This interface
can be customized to suit each programmer's particular needs.  APE
is capable of interfacing with any programming language, as well
as other file processing commands such as nroff and LaTeX, so you
can use the same environment for both code and documentation
development.

APE is designed to get the most out of your existing hardware.
The first time you run APE, you'll probably be surprised to see
what an ASCII terminal can do!
