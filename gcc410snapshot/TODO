1) Option gcc-graphite is no longer set as default. The necessary isl
from pkgsrc is incompatible. This has been resolved by using isl/cloog
in source downloaded from gcc/infrastructure. But right now this only works
with --disable-bootstrap on NetBSD. Make this work for a full bootstrap.
  In my opinion graphite is obsolete. I once got a reduction of runtime
from 6 hours to 4 hours by using -ftree-loop-linear from graphite for a big
simulation code. The runtime of some loops were reduced by a factor of ten
by reordering the loops into fortran order. But you only get this speedups
with bad fortran code. Using profiling or -fopt-info-missed would quickly
detect the slow loops as well. The picture might change with the simd
option of OpenMP 4.0, available for C and partly added for gfortran. 
 
2) Help adding missing long double and complex support in NetBSD.

3) lang/gcc48 has been split into several packages and is currently
broken. If it reaches a usable state mabey gcc410snapshot should be
split as well to keep it in sync.
