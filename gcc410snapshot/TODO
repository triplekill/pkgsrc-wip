1) No longer build graphite by default. The necessary isl from pkgsrc
is incompatible. This can be resolved by using isl/cloog in source
downloaded from gcc/infrastructure. But right now this only works
with --disable-bootstrap on NetBSD. In my opinion graphite is
obsolete. I once got a reduction of runtime from 6 hours to
4 hours by using -ftree-loop-linear from graphite with a big simulation
code. The runtime of some loops were reduced by a factor of ten by
reordering the loops into fortran order. But you only get this speedups
with bad fortran code. Using profiling or -fopt-info-missed would quickly
detect the slow loops as well. 
 
2) Help adding missing long double and complex support in NetBSD.

3) lang/gcc48 has been changed to a meta package. Mabey this should be used
for lang/gcc410snapshot as well.
