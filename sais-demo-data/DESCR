This package contains the free data files from the demo version
of the game "Strange Adventures in Infinite Space" (SAIS).

The demo is a considerably scaled-down version of the full game
and is designed to help players become familiar with the SAIS game
system.

The demo version of SAIS features:

  # 8 different ship types
  # 29 different weapons, drives, shields, gadgets and artifacts
  # 6 alien lifeforms
  # 17 different planet and star types
  # 2 unique alien races

The star map does not randomize for each game, instead, one fixed
star map with fewer stars to explore is provided for easy, normal
and hard difficulty settings.

No exotic weapons, usable artifacts or advanced ship systems are
included in this version of the game. It does, however, include
the combat simulator so players can prepare for the real thing.
