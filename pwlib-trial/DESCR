PWLib is a moderately large class library that has its genesis
many years ago as a method to produce applications to run on 
both Microsoft Windows and Unix X-Windows systems. It also was 
to have a Macintosh port as well but this never eventuated.

Since then the system has grown to having quite good application 
to areas other than mere Windows GUI portability. Classes for 
I/O portability, multi-threading portability, aid in producing 
unix daemons and NT services portably and all sorts of internet 
protocols were added over the years.

The library was used extensively for all our in-house products. 
Then we decided to support the open H323 project by throwing in 
some of the code written for one of our products. Thus, required
PWLib so it got thrown into the open source world as well.
