kBuild is a makefile framework for writing simple makefiles for
complex tasks.

The goals of the kBuild framework:

    Similar behavior cross all supported platforms.
    Flexibility, don't create unnecessary restrictions preventing
    ad-hoc solutions.
    Makefile very simple to write and maintain.

There are four concepts being tried out in the current kBuild
incaration:

    One configuration file for a subtree automatically included.
    Target configuration templates as the primary mechanism for
    makefile simplification.
    Tools and SDKs for helping out the templates with flexibility.
    Non-recursive makefile method by using sub-makefiles.
