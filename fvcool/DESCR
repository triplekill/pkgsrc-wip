As is well known AMD's Athlon/Duron is a "hot" CPU. It really produces a
lot of heat. This is mainly because it consumes a lot of electric power.
However, there is an another reason: Generally CPU goes into power-save mode
when it is in the idle state, but in almost all the mother boards this is
prohibited in the case of Athlon/Duron mother boards in their original BIOS
settings.

This software changes the PCI configuration data of the chipset (north
bridge), and allow Athlon/Duron to go into power-save mode. The principle is
very simple if you have information. Actually, you can do exactly the same
thing as this software manually by using the "pciconf" command in FreeBSD.

Supported chipsets:
   AMD 751/761/762
   Sis 730, 735
   VIA KT266/A/333
   VIA KT133/A/KX133
