Dnsmasq is lightweight, easy to configure DNS forwarder
designed to provide DNS (domain name) services to a small
network where using BIND would be overkill. It can have its
upstream DNS servers automatically configured by PPP or DHCP,
and it can serve the names of local machines which are not in
the global DNS. It can integrate with the ISC DHCP daemon to
serve the names of local machines which are configured using
DHCP. Dnsmasq is ideal for networks behind NAT routers and
connected via modem, ISDN, ADSL, or cable-modem connections.
