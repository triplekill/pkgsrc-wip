Fix installation.

These comments were for the 1.5 version of the package:

Install appropriate destination (/usr/pkg/bin, etc...) instead of
${PREFIX}/firebird.

Firebird can be compiled as "classic" and "super" version -- I have
no idea how do they differ; I think, when it is ready, Makefile
should be divided in Makefile and Makefile.common and package should
be split in "firebird" and "firebird-super".
