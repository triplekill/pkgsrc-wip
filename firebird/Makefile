# A few words about DISTFILE:
#
# DISTFILE included it *NOT* an official firebird.sf.net source code release.
# 
# As Firebird-1.5 sources are unavailable via direct download from SF.net (it
# is only possible to do cvs checkout), FreeBSD's port maintainer -- Chris
# Knight <chris(at)e-easy(dot)com(dot)au> -- created a downloadable .tar.bz2
# file as a checkout of 1.5RC8 tag. I have contacted him; he will be trying to
# put that DISTFILE on SF.net page . As FreeBSD Ports use the same sources, I
# think we can trust them. FreeBSD package was commited to FreeBSD Ports
# repository by developer netchild(at)freebsd(dot)org
#
# I think, that in near future either Chris will put the sources on SF.net, or
# some trusted NetBSD developer will be able to do source checkout and put the
# tarball somewhere on NetBSD site.

# WARNING:

# M4= is illegal, I know. But -- how can I enforce installation
# of gnu M4 4.14 from packages _and_ using it in the env?
#
# On FreeBSD 4-STABLE it just _needs_ to be installed, as the
# basesystem package is either non-GNU or is older, than needed
# (propably both, I didn't examine this too closely)
