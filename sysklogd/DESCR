This is the sysklogd package for Linux.

The sysklogd package implements two system log daemons.  The syslogd
daemon is the general system logging daemon which is responsible for
handling requests for syslog services.  This version of syslogd is
similar to the standard Berkeley product but with a number of compatible
extensions.  The klogd daemon runs either standalone or as a client
of syslogd.  Klogd 'listens' to kernel log messages, prioritizes them
and routes them to either output files or to syslogd.  This version
of klogd will optionally translate kernel addresses to their symbolic
equivalents if provided with a system map.

This is Dr. Greg W. Wettstein's version of sysklogd.  It is maintained
by Martin Schulze.
