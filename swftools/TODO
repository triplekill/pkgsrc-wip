* many tools core dumped on NetBSD 2.0/i386
  need to check with recent NetBSD release.
* 0.9.2 uses fmax(3) unconditionally
  failed to build on NetBSD<5.1 (and others lacking of fmax(3)).
* Failed to build with poppler instead of builtin xpdf.
  It is better using poppler for security reason, but need to catch up
  poppler API changes.
* add dependency on math/fftwf
  but on 0.9.2, it result in no feature enhancement due to following commit:
    http://wiki.swftools.org/viewgit/?a=commitdiff&p=swftools-git%20&h=9dff415641fd3de8e8c4cfd572db43c087eb99a7

  I'm not sure whether it is consciously or not.
