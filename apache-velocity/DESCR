Velocity is a Java-based template engine. It permits anyone to use the simple
 yet powerful template language to reference objects defined in Java code. When
Velocity is used for web development, Web designers can work in parallel with
Java programmers to develop web sites according to the Model-View-Controller
(MVC) model, meaning that web page designers can focus solely on creating a site
that looks good, and programmers can focus solely on writing top-notch code.
Velocity separates Java code from the web pages, making the web site more
maintainable over the long run and providing a viable alternative to Java Server
Pages (JSPs) or PHP.
