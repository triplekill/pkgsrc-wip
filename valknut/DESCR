Valknut is a program that uses the Direct Connect protocol to connect
to peer-to-peer filesharing hubs. It is compatible with other DC clients,
such as the original DC from Neomodus, DC++ and derivatives. Valknut also
interoperates with all common DC hub software. It uses the QT toolkit
for user interaction.
