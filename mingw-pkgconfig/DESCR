pkg-config is a system for managing library compile/link flags that
works with automake and autoconf.  It replaces the ubiquitous
*-config scripts you may have seen with a single tool.

Despite its name, this project is not related to the NetBSD package
system!

This pkg has been hacked so it provides pkg-config services for
mingw32-compiled applications.
