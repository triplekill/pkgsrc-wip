The main differences to Links are:

* Tabbed browsing - you may use tabs either in graphical or even in text mode.
* Lua scripting - ported from Links-Lua, not from current ELinks code, but the
  differences are not so sensitive, I hope.
* HTTP Auth - stable, ported from Elinks
* HTTP Proxy Auth - ported from Elinks, need to be checked.
* Cookies saving - ported from ELinks, now our HTTP-header date parsing is
  correct, I hope.
* New options system - inspired by ELinks one, but much more uglier currently.
  Only a few options are implemented through it. Press 'Ctrl+o' to call
  options manager.
* Possibility to open new windows instead of new links instances in graphics
  mode new socket is created with name 'glinks' in links dir instead of 'links'
  for text instances, so they can work independently. After that command
  'links -g works like 'mozilla -remote', simply opening new instances from
  currently running one. But it has some limitations - these new windows will
  open on the same display as original one...

And more ...
