To fix a problem with one particular combination:

The problem I was raising here turned out that
ghostscript has a problem with TrueType font if
option -dSAFER is designated.
This is filed as [Bug 691780] 
  http://bugs.ghostscript.com/show_bug.cgi?id=691780
If -dSAFER in (/usr/pkg/bin/) ps2pdfwr is removed 
as the patch attached, all the processing are OK.

(Previous note):
------------
(1) the option at 
wip/ghostscrip-cidfonts-ryumin
set
PKG_OPTIONS.gcr_type= ipa

(2) and only if gs invoked from dvipdfmx via following sequence:
    ps2pdf
    ps2pdf14
    ps2pdfwr
    gs -sDEVICE=pdfwrite

gs failed to find the font Ryumin-Light-EUC-H
----

Meaning that 
(a) if
PKG_OPTIONS.gcr_type= adobe-cidfonts
set -> OK

(b) 
gs alone invoked command line, the same file 
(included in *.eps used above (2) problem)
can be processed successfully even if
following line in /etc/mk.conf mentioned in (1)
PKG_OPTIONS.gcr_type= ipa
is set.
