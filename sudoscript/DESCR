Sudoscript provides an audited shell using sudo(8) and script(1).  The
front end script, sudoshell(1) contacts the daemon, sudoscriptd(8).
They agree on the location of a FIFO, which the daemon opens for read.
Sudoshell then runs scropt(1) with the FIFO as a typescript.  The
daemon stamps each line of the script(1) outpur with a session id,
then passes the data over to another daemon.  This daemon timestamps
the data and stores it in a log file, /var/log/sudscript.  This daemon
also keeps an eye on the size of the log, and forks a
rotator/compressor when it exceeds 2 MiB.
