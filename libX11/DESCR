This is the libX11 library that is the C binding to the X protocol. It
is the foundation of practically every X Window System program out there.

This is the freedesktop.org version. It is based on libX11 from XFree86.

The goals of this project are (1) to get libX11 out of the huge XF86
hunk of code, (2) to make it buildable with autotools, (3) keep the
ability to easily merge bug fixes from libX11 in XF86 into this code,
(4) make it possible for people to work with Xlib without having to deal
with the entire XFree86 distribution, so that bugs can get detected and
fixed, and (5) provide a place to move the X library forward.
