later when available, package
 Xdmcp - X Display Manager Control Protocol library
 libXt (not available yet from freedesktop.org)

- any want to maintain this?

Make sure that this uses correct major and minor numbers
for libraries. Mine installed:
/usr/lib/libX11.so.0
/usr/lib/libX11.so.0.0
My workaround was to create symlink and then I could use xev client
which also used /usr/lib/libXau.so.0.

When I got rid of the LIBTOOL_OVERRIDE, the library versions were correct:
/usr/lib/libX11.so.6
/usr/lib/libX11.so.6.2.1

So maybe we need to fix the libtool or maybe don't use LIBTOOL_OVERRIDE.
I believe this is the same for all these freedesktop.org xlibs packages.
