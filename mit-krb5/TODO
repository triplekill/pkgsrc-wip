pkglint complains: "WARN: is "mit-krb5" sane as package name WITHOUT
version number? if not, avoid "-" in version number part of PKGNAME."

pkglint says: "WARN: use of INTERACTIVE_STAGE discouraged. provide
batch mode by using BATCH an d/or FOR_CDROM."
But not explained in Packages.txt.

maybe install info files and html
from ${WRKSRC}/../doc/

maybe Kerberized r-services, telnet and ftp services
should be a different option? or different package(s)?

the manual pages for the Kerberized r-services, telnet and ftp services
don't mention the "k" plus don't mention any Kerberos.

why was /usr/man/man1/tmac.doc installed?
I removed it in patch-ad (which also changes telnet to ktelnet)

check for bison or yacc before doing BUILD_DEPENDS
and set YACC accordingly
(maybe this should include some pkgsrc/mk/yacc.mk file)

options for krb4 compatibility?

why? /usr/etc/cups/certs/0
 @dirrm etc/cups/certs
(I saw that on a Linux install, two different times.)

have kth-krb conflict too
or have both install to own lib and include directories
and fix buildlink2.mk files for each

maybe do the patches differently for adding "k" prefix
don't use --program-transform-name='s,^,k,'  because it will change all

build with --enable-dns ??

install krb5.conf? kdc.conf?

install rc.d script(s) to start kadmind and/or kdc ??

maybe telnetd and login tools don't honor NetBSD's
login.conf(5) and login_cap(3)
