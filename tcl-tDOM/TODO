- figure out why the shared object is called libtdom082.so on NetBSD and
  libtdom0.8.2.so on Linux because it breaks PLIST. 
- try to avoid in-tree expat (I'm making a patch for their autoconf which
  defaults to system-expat)
- fix download links (Project has moved to github, but I'm not commiting any
  files other than TODO until I hear from phonohawk, the maintainer)
