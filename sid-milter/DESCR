An open source implementation of the Sender ID specification as defined by the
Internet Engineering Task Force's (IETF).

The Sender ID proposal includes three different specifications:
draft-lyon-senderid-core-01.txt
draft-lyon-senderid-pra-01.txt
draft-schlitt-spf-classic-02.txt

This implementation is part of the Sendmail Messaging Integrity program, a
comprehensive testing initiative designed to gather real-world usage data by
evaluating several aspects of various leading sender authentication schemes
against a wide range of SMTP software operating today.

This software is being provided to the open source community for the purposes
of testing the DomainKeys approach against various implementations of mail
transport agents, mail list managers, forwarding services, and various other
SMTP software.

THIS IS PRE-RELEASE SOFTWARE, and should not be used in any critical
production environments.
