An open source implementation of the Sender ID specification as defined by the 
Internet Engineering Task Force's (IETF).

The Sender ID proposal includes three different specifications:
draft-ietf-marid-core-03 
draft-ietf-marid-protocol-02 
draft-ietf-marid-submitter-03 

sid-milter implements the -core and -protocol specifications. -submitter 
requires an optional SMTP extension that would be implemented in the sendmail 
MTA.

This implementation is part of the Sendmail Messaging Integrity program, a 
comprehensive testing initiative designed to gather real-world usage data by 
evaluating several aspects of various leading sender authentication schemes 
against a wide range of SMTP software operating today.

This software is being provided to the open source community for the purposes 
of testing the DomainKeys approach against various implementations of mail 
transport agents, mail list managers, forwarding services, and various other 
SMTP software.

THIS IS PRE-RELEASE SOFTWARE, and should not be used in any critical 
production environments.
