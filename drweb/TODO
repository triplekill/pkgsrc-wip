- [jmmv] Several cleanup.

- [jmmv] Test if it works properly (use the wip/drweb-* clients).

- Wait until DrWeb 4.30.x for NetBSD will released, then support
  it.  Just at this moment it runs under FreeBSD binary emulation.

- Eliminate dependency on wget for systems, which have its own
  downloaders.

Please also note that all precomplied software available (at least
tested) for i386 only. The sources (clients) have all chances to
work on other architectures (someone has reported running sendmail
filter on Solaris/UltraSPARC and I've tested drweb-dc on NetBSD/macppc).
