- [jmmv] Several cleanup.

- [jmmv] Test if it works properly (use the wip/drweb-* clients).

- Wait until DrWeb 4.30 for NetBSD will released, then support it.
  Just at this moment it runs under FreeBSD binary emulation.

- It is possible use both variants of DrWeb/Linux - for glibc 2.2
  and for glibc 2.3 (customizable with GLIBC_VERSION option).
  However, user have no assistance on what versions are available
  to choose. Solve this.

- Eliminate dependency on wget for systems, which have its own
  downloaders.

- The drweb-update script must be modified to allow use of externally
  supplied login and password.

Please also note that all precomplied software available (at least
tested) for i386 only. The sources (clients) have all chances to
work on other architectures (someone has reported running sendmail
filter on Solaris/UltraSPARC and I've tested drweb-dc on NetBSD/macppc).
