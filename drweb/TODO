- Several cleanup.

- Test if it works properly.

- It can works on FreeBSD (natively), and NetBSD, OpenBSD (in
  emulation).  Thus, so as pkgsrc is a cross-platform framework,
  this package should be available on that systems too.

  Please note both scanner and daemon was compiled to ran natively
  on NetBSD and OpenBSD, but both are in experimental and in beta
  stage at once.

- There is existent DrWeb for Solaris/i386. Made it work from
  pkgsrc, as well as for xBSD and Linux variants.

  Please note DrWeb for Linux has been built in two variants - for
  glibc 2.2 and for glibc 2.3. this package will install glibc 2.3
  only.

- There is available (even as sources) some clients for drweb daemon.
  Create a packages for all of them. Currently on NetBSD have been
  tried a cmd line client with success, and sendmail filter (milter)
  with fatal bugs in POSIX threads code. Thus, first step is
  implement clean installation, and then make it works on NetBSD.
  Please note that clients for Linux and FreeBSD are in production
  release.

- Eliminate dependency on wget (?).

- After all, upgrade to DrWeb 4.30 (developers are promised make
  a native release for NetBSD as well as for other platforms).

Please also note that all precomplied software available (at least
tested) for i386 only. The sources (clients) had all chances to
work on other architectures (someone has reported running sendmail
filter on Solaris/UltraSPARC)
