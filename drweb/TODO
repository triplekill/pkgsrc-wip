- Several cleanup.

- Test if it works properly.

- It can works on FreeBSD (natively), and NetBSD, OpenBSD (in
  emulation).  Thus, so as pkgsrc is a cross-platform framework,
  this package must be available on that systems too.  (Please note
  both scanner and daemon was compiled to ran natively on NetBSD
  and OpenBSD, but both are in "double-beta" stage.)

- There is existent DrWeb for Linux and Solaris. Made it work from
  pkgsrc, as well as for xBSD variants.

- There is available (even in souces) some clients for drweb daemon.
  Create a packages for all of them. Currently on NetBSD have been
  tried a cmd line client with success, and sendmail filter (milter)
  with fatal bugs in POSIX threads code. Thus, first step is
  implement clean installation, and then make it works on NetBSD.
  Please note that clients for Linux and FreeBSD are in production
  release.

Please also note that all software available (it least tested) on
i386 only.
