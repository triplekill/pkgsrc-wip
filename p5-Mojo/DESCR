Mojo is a collection of libraries and example web frameworks for web
framework developers.
If you are searching for a higher level MVC web framework you should
take a look at Mojolicious.
Don't be scared by the amount of different modules in the distribution
they are all very loosely coupled.
You can just pick the ones you like and ignore the rest
there is no tradeoff.
