Theora is Xiph.Org's video codec, intended for use within the Ogg
project's Ogg multimedia streaming system.  Theora is derived
directly from On2's VP3 codec.

This also includes example programs that implement a mixed-stream
(Theora/Vorbis) Ogg encoder and SDL-based player.

This is alpha testing software; the API will probably change.
This package is theora from the nightly CVS snapshots.
