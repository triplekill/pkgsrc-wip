HTTP::Lite is a stand-alone lightweight HTTP/1.1 implementation
for perl.  It is not intended as a replacement for the fully-features
LWP module.  Instead, it is intended for use in situations where
it is desirable to install the minimal number of modules to achieve
HTTP support, or where LWP is not a good candidate due to CPU
overhead, such as slower processors.  HTTP::Lite is also significantly
faster than LWP.

HTTP::Lite is ideal for CGI (or mod_perl) programs or for bundling
for redistribution with larger packages where only HTTP GET and
POST functionality are necessary.

HTTP::Lite supports basic POST and GET operations only.  As of
0.2.1, HTTP::Lite supports HTTP/1.1 and is compliant with the Host
header, necessary for name based virtual hosting.  Additionally,
HTTP::Lite now supports Proxies.

As of 2.0.0 HTTP::Lite now supports a callback to allow processing
of request data as it arrives.  This is useful for handling very
large files without consuming memory.

If you require more functionality, such as FTP or HTTPS, please
see libwwwperl (LWP).  LWP is a significantly better and more
comprehensive package than HTTP::Lite, and should be used instead
of HTTP::Lite whenever possible.
