This package provides support for documents marked up using the reStructuredText
format. Support includes font locking as well as some convenience functions for
editing. It does this by defining a Emacs major mode.

The package is based on `text-mode' and inherits some things from it.
Particularly `text-mode-hook' is run before `rst-mode-hook'.
