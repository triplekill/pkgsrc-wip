awflwm is an extension of Bill Spitzak's wonderful Fast Light Window Manager
(flwm).  There are a few reasons that this project has been created:

    * flwm has not been updated in quite some time.
    * flwm does not compile against the 1.1.x branch of fltk (though
      it is an easy fix).
    * I'd personally like to know what the result of moving the configuration
      options from a compile-time-only scheme to a configuration file (aside
      from a slightly larger executable) would be.
    * Speaking of executable size, it wouldn't add too much to the code if
      guile were embedded into the window manager so that it can be extended
      without having to recompile.

Aside from the above listed items, awflwm is more-or-less exactly like flwm
(though the newer fltk versions cause it to act slightly differently).
