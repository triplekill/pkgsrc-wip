set up patch for NetBSD, like:
includes/cf/netbsd.h
and common/bpf.c and common/fddi.c to use NETBSD_FDDI
(see NetBSD's /usr/src/dist/dhcp)

look at http://www.gentoo.org/cgi-bin/viewcvs.cgi/net-misc/dhcp/
should I have a "dhcp" user?
chroot?
what is paranoia patch?

Use MAKE_DIRS_PERMS for /var/db/dhcp         
maybe should be named /var/db/isc-dhcp ?
does that conflict with other dhcp?

should this install shared libraries?

should this document the libraries/headers in DESCR?

patch the various Makefile.dist to change all target to use SEDMANPAGES instead
(so nroff is not done)

rc.d script: 
 * make it obey VAR_DIR setting (should be easy) (mpasternak)
 * should it use name isc_dhcpd ? perhaps one rc.d script could be used
   to run dhcpd, with optional dhcpd_type set to different types of dhcpd
   servers (but, by that time, dhcpd servers should be non conflicting at
   install) (mpasternak)
 * _TEST_ isc-dhclient rc.d script - I didn't test it too much ;) (mpasternak)
