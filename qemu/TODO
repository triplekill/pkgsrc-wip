As far as I know, this package only will compile and install on
NetBSD-1.6.  I have no machine to test it on 2.0 or 1.5.  I know iti
won't work on Linux, and I doubt it will work on any other platforms.

I hope to contribute to QEMU towards making it more portable in
future versions, so the hackjob I do on it with patches won't be
necessary, and this package can support more platforms.

QEMU is very picky about the compiler you use, and it is not very
clear which ones work and which don't.  I got this particular package
to work with NetBSD-1.6.2's gcc (2.95.3).  I have no idea if other
versions will work or not, which further complicates the job of
getting the package to work on more platforms.

I will have to look into all of this more, but for now, QEMU is
still in the early stages of the project, and we can expect that it
will change significantly and rapidly.  If you want to try this 
*beta* software, then go for it...just try and find a 1.6 box to
compile it.  (or use the qemu-bin package)
