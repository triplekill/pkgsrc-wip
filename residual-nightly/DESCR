Residual is a ScummVM (http://www.scummvm.org/) sub-project to play LucasArts'
LUA-based 3D adventures, such as Grim Fandango. Residual is an OpenGL program,
and requires a 3D card with working OpenGL support for optimum playability.

A software renderer is also included for machines without hardware OpenGL.
