		whitespace after semicolons.

		those which aren't in test mode.
	Ignore unknown tags in keys and policies, rather than returning an
		error.
	LIBDK: Return an error if the signing function returned success but
		also reported a zero-length signature.  Reported by
		S. Moonesamy of Eland Systems.
	LIBAR: Add a timeout to the I/O wait so that retransmissions
		actually get done while waiting for activity.

0.3.3		2006/03/13
	Fix test mode check at the end of mlfi_eom(), which was overriding
		any configuration settings from the command line.
		Reported by Arkadi Poliakevitch of Invidi Technologies.
	Copy the value of -C before parsing it so the output of "ps" doesn't
		get munged.  Reported by Arkadi Poliakevitch of Invidi
		Technologies.

		Lentz.
	Add _FFR_LOG_SSL_ERRORS which sends to syslog errors reported by
		the OpenSSL libraries.

	Patch a small but definite memory leak.  Reported by Ray Krebs
		of eBay.

0.3.1		2005/12/02

		of the signature (and, in fact, other things at the end
		of the signature).  Reported by Jason Long.  (Bug SF1234164)
	Don't reject or report about messages which fail verification
		when the sending domain advertises that it's in test mode.
		Patch from Adrian Havill.
	Fixes to POPAUTH compilation from S. Moonesamy of Eland Systems.
	Allow "-d" to specify a list from which domains should be read,
		and allow wildcarding in domain names.  Requested by
		Ray Krebs of eBay.  (Feature request SF1312453)
	Add "-o" command line option to allow certain headers to be omitted
		from signing operations.  Suggested by Ben Lentz.
		(Feature request SF1314350)
	LIBAR: Fix a build issue introduced in the last release.
