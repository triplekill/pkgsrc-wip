$NetBSD$

- Licence `no-profit' seems to be deprecated (according to pkglint(1)),
  what should LICENCE be set to? The Sendmail licence shipping with
  the distfile and pkgsrc/licenses/sendmail-licence differ...

- Are the pkglint(1) warnings for options.mk safe to ignore?

- Decide whether some (all?) of the FFR (for future release) features
  (see FEATURES file in the distfile) should be made available through
  the options framework.

- Test the package and have it tested by others. I'm using it with
  Postfix 2.4.3 on NetBSD/i386 and so far it seems to work fine.
