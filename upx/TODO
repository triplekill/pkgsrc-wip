* UPX does not pack NetBSD binaries, but it can be built on NetBSD and
  used to manipulate Linux binaries.

* The UPX packed Linux binary I tried to run under Linux emulation did
  not work, so I resorted to building UPX and unpacking the binary.  I
  should have worked on resolving the conflict between COMPAT_LINUX
  and the UPX stub, if I had the time.

* Verify whether this builds and runs on architectures other than i386.

* Make patches only apply for NetBSD build, and not for Linux build.
