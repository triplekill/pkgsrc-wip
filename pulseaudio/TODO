--Fix shared memory code
--Implement scheduler activations for NetBSD
--possibly get solaris module working on NetBSD for /dev/audio
--Fix dynamic module detection (am I doing dlopen wrong?)
	Does it even matter because it seems to only want to make static
	libraries?
--Add pulse user/group in Makefile
--Fix PLIST generation (libtool issue and conf files)
--Use SUBST_* macros where appropriate (example already there)
--Use CONF_FILES framework
--And more.

-- This package has a known vulnerability, please investigate and fix if possible. (see: http://aluigi.altervista.org/adv/pulsex-adv.txt)

At least it works now!
