BE CAREFUL WHEN INSTALLING THIS ALONGSIDE ESOUND.  IT MAY OR MAY NOT
GENERATE FILES WITH THE SAME NAMES OF THE ESOUND EXECUTABLES.

To use it alongside esound (you will likely have to do this to build
programs which require libesd), comment out the CONFLICTS line.

This should be fixed soon.  See MESSAGE for more information.

You may have to do make install CHECK_FILES=no when installing this
the PLIST generation is currently borked.
