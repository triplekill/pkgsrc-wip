$NetBSD$

This package is far from complete, but it does work!  It is
probably leaking some amount of memory at least upon exit,
but I'm not sure how much (nothing bad has happened to me yet,
but caveat emptor [yes I know you're not buying anything, but
I dont know much latin] and all that.

This package does not behave properly re: CONF_FILES framework,
so the configuration files are already in ${LOCALBASE}/etc/pulse.
They're relatively inuitive.  To get this to work, comment out the
module autodetection (both of them), the gconf module, and basically
everything but ossaudio and esd support.  I included my configuration
file (not much special about it) in the files directory of this
package.

Once you have that done, you need to run the 'esdcompat' shell
script with bash.  Well, at least NetBSD's /bin/sh has a problem with
all the shifting going on.  It takes the same arguments as esd.
Start it as a daemon using the unix protocol with -nobeeps (the
audio files it looks for currently are included with GNOME, ugh).
It should work.

Enjoy!  And if you want to help me with this beast, please let me know.
