The package only builds/installs the Apache module for now. The Nginx port
should probably be implemented via OPTION framework inside www/nginx instead.

Compared to a straight 'gem install', minor patching done to keep a more
sane file system layout, but I'm not going to patch every Ruby script they
have. Rubygems wrappers for bin scripts are not created under PREFIX/bin
for now, but can be done if somebody shows me how to call that functionality
directly.

Still have problems building a functional package with GCC 4.4.x
on Solaris, but I'll follow up on that with upstream. Confirmed
working on NetBSD 5.0.1/amd64.
