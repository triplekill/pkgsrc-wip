The package only builds/installs the Apache module for now. The Nginx port
should be implemented via OPTION framework inside www/nginx instead. The
new 'Passenger Lite' embedded server requires two gems currently not in
pkgsrc, and while it's officially built using the 'passenger' script contained
in this package, it could become a separate package on its own.
