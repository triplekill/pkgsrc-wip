$NetBSD$

THERE ARE NO MAN PAGES. All installed documentation
is accessible through

	file://localhost${PREFIX}/share/doc/html/ntp4/index.htm

User to user support is available at

	news:comp.protocols.time.ntp

and online docs are viewable through NTP's home at

	http://www.ntp.org/

To get this running on NetBSD 1.5 and above:

1.	Set ntpd=YES in /etc/rc.conf and set any flags that may be necessary 
	for your environment using ntpd_flags="".

2.	At this time the ntpd_chrootdir flag is supported with this package,
	it's just not documented. Add ntpd_chrootdir="/var/chroot/ntpd" 
	in rc.conf to get ntpd running in a chroot evironment. 
	For this to work correctly you will also need to add the following 
	to your kernel config file and compile a new kernel:

	pseudo-device   clockctl

	Also ensure that /dev/clockctl exists.

3.	Add a file called "ntpd" to /etc/rc.conf.d with the following entries:
	command="${PREFIX}/bin/${name}".
