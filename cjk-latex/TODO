 * Figure out what cjk-latex-japanese (etc?) is good for, and how it can
   be used automatically (examples/JIS.tex can't be translated with it!)
 * maybe integrate with cjk-latex-wadalab, which can be used (w/o
   cjk-latex-japanese) to get examplex/JIS.tex to work for latex, xdvi,
   dvips and dvipdfm
 * Rename things when importing into pkgsrc:

	cjk-latex		=> tex-cjk
	cjk-latex-chinese	=> tex-cjk-chinese
	cjk-latex-japanese	=> tex-cjk-japanese
	cjk-latex-korean	=> tex-cjk-korean
	cjk-latex-wadalab	=> tex-cjk-japanese-wadalab
