 * Figure out what cjk-latex-japanese (etc?) is good for, and how it can
   be used automatically (examples/JIS.tex can't be translated with it!)
 * maybe integrate with cjk-latex-wadalab, which can be used (w/o
   cjk-latex-japanese) to get examplex/JIS.tex to work for latex, xdvi,
   dvips and dvipdfm
