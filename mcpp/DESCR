MCPP is an alternative C/C++ preprocessor with the highest conformance,
implementated by Kiyoshi Matsui.  It supports multiple standards: K&R,
ISO C90, ISO C99, and ISO C++98.  MCPP is especially useful for
debugging the source program which use complicated macros and also
useful for checking portability of the source.

Although mcpp could be built as a replacement of GCC's resident
preprocessor or as a subroutine called from some other main program,
this package installs only a stand-alone program named 'mcpp' which
behaves independent from GCC.
