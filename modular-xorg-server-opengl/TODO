--How do we wish to integrate this into modular-xorg-server?  Options?
--Don't we have to use CONF_FILES with this, etc? no?  
--I am a newcomer to pkgsrc development, so please let me know if there is 
anything I should have done differently.
--Anything else for buildlink3.mk? (not included here because you might as well
link to the real one)
--Add more to TODO. ;)
