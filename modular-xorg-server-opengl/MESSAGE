To ensure OpenGL applications work properly, please apply the diff in
files/ to the root of your pkgsrc tree and do 'make distinfo' in
each of the Mesa directories (MesaLib, glu, and glut).  Then, change
the flags in WRKSRC/configs/pkgsrc to -DPTHREADS -DGLXEXT -DGLX_USE_MESA
-DUSE_GAS and -D__GLX_ALIGN64 if you're using a 64-bit platform.  Build
and install Mesa 6.5.2.  Then, change -DGLX_GLXEXT_LEGACY in
MesaLib/buildlink3.mk to -DGLX_GLXEXT_PROTOTYPES.  If there are any
rejected patches, just look at them and apply it manually; I haven't had
time to fix it yet.


This step is most likely necessary right now so that the Mesa version
the server requires is also in userland.  Alternatively, you can
just use Mesa 6.4.2, but you've been duly warned. ;)
