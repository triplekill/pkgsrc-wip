The X.org X11 Server from the modularized source tree of
X.org X11.  This package is my current hack-ish effort to build-in
Mesa to modular-xorg-server.  IMHO, we should just package our own glcore/glx
module (we can build it a la src/x11) and link it with the server. Another
option is to set up our own GL tree inside WRKSRC which could not qualify
for listing in _The Devil's Dictionary_ under "broken".  mesa-symlinks build
system is an abhorrent abomination--PURE EVIL.

This package should work on amd64 and i386.  For other hardware, please
contact me and I will gladly try to help or refer you to someone who can.


Many thanks to joerg@ and reed@ for all their work on packaging modular X.org.
