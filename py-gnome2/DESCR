gnome-python -- Python bindings for GNOME2
====================================

Author: James Henstridge <james@daa.com.au>

This is a set of bindings for the GNOME libraries for use with python. To
use them, you will also need the pygtk package compiled and installed. It
can be found at either:
  ftp://ftp.daa.com.au/pub/james/python/
  ftp://ftp.gnome.org/pub/GNOME/sources/gnome-python/
  ftp://ftp.python.org/pub/contrib/Graphics/

You will need gnome-libs 1.0.9 or later installed on your system (the
newer the better).  Optionally, gnome-core 1.0.x and control-center
1.0.x can be used.  If they are detected, they add support for writing
panel applets and control center capplets respectively.
