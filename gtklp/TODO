(gtklp:3418): Gtk-WARNING **: Could not find the icon 'gnome-fs-home'. The 'hicolor' theme
was not found either, perhaps you need to install it.
You can get a copy from:

Nits: The InstallableOptions group is special (see PPD spec); its values are
determined by the installed printer hardware and only informative to the user
(and usable in constraint checks). GtkLP lets the user "change" them; it even
saves the (now wrong) values in ~/.lpoptions and remembers them later.

The 'call GtkLPQ' button freezes the GtkLP window until the user exits
GtkLPQ. Haven't looked to see whether GtkLP is really just doing a wait(2),
or if it tries to do something asynchronous that isn't working in my build.

If a job can't be printed (say, the printer is rejecting jobs) the message
to stderr says "Unable to print!" but doesn't say why. (xpp includes the
status message.)
