DirectFB is a thin library that provides hardware graphics acceleration,
input device handling and abstraction, integrated windowing system with
support for translucent windows and multiple display layers on top of the
Linux Framebuffer Device.
It is a complete hardware abstraction layer with software fallbacks for
every graphics operation that is not supported by the underlying hardware.
DirectFB adds graphical power to embedded systems and sets a new standard
for graphics under Linux.
