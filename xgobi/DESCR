This package provides two programs: XGobi and XGvis.

XGobi is an interactive dynamic graphics program for  data
visualization  in  the  X Window System.  It is especially
designed for the exploration of  multivariate  data.   Its
basic  plot  is  a  scatterplot, and these are some of the
tools available for scatterplot display and manipulation.

XGvis is an  interactive  multidimensional  scaling  (MDS)
program that consists of a control panel to manipulate the
parameters of the MDS stress function and an xgobi  window
for data display.  It can be used either for visualization
of dissimilarity data, for  dimension  reduction,  or  for
graph  layout.   Graph  layout  is usually done in 2D, but
xgvis allows layouts in arbitrary dimensions, 3D being the
default.   It permits missing values, which can be used to
implement multidimensional unfolding.
