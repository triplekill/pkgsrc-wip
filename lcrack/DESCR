Lepton's Crack is a generic password cracker. It is easily-customizable with
a simple plugin system and allows system administrators to review the quality
of the passwords being used on their systems. It can perform a dictionary-based
(wordlist) attack as well as a brute force (incremental) password scan,
including the use of regular expressions. It supports standard MD4 hash,
standard MD5 hash, NT MD4/Unicode, Lotus Domino HTTP password (R4), and SHA-1
hash formats. LM (LAN Manager) plus appending and prepending of characters is
available in the Development branch (strongly recommended).
