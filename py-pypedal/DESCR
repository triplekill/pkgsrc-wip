PyPedal provides an API that may be used to maniuplate pedigrees in a number
of ways. Key metrics include coefficients of inbreeding and relationship;
effective founder and ancestor numbers; and expected inbreeding from a given
mating. If you have Graphviz and  pydot installed, PyPedal can be used to
produce a graph from your pedigree
