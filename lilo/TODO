upgrade to lilo-22.5.7.2

use pkgsrc tool to replace path to sh and path to perl

perl is used for keytab-lilo script --
 maybe rewrite?

maybe the examples should be put in an examples directory?

this should note that it uses $PREFIX/boot 
should put under share/lilo/boot
or set LOCALBASE to / for just /boot

also check what this is for
cat $ROOT/etc/lilo.defines
maybe that changes the build

this should install a lilo.conf with conf files

# boot/ directory may have file boot.300 or whatever later generated
for example:
Backup copy of boot sector in /usr/boot/boot.1600

# have option to copy to /boot in addition or instead of PREFIX/boot

# maybe include QuickInst as example

depends on ...
# bin86 builds under Linux but not NetBSD, and
# bcc builds under NetBSD, but not Linux -- both need to be fixed
#BUILD_DEPENDS+=		bcc>=95.3.12:../../devel/bcc
BUILD_DEPENDS+=		bin86>=0.16.9:../../devel/bin86
