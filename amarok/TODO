* Find a better work around for locale files installation
* Add external SQLite dependency
* Check if xmms is required in runtime or just to build
* Send PR to authors to add option like "--without-xmms"
* Make Xine, GStream and NNM specific package

Right now pkg-configure dosn't return --modversion for sqlite.
I guess this is the reason why configure fails to find external
databases/sqlite. Need to fix it.
