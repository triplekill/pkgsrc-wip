test without MIT kerbeors -- try with NetBSD's heimdal instead.

test swat

maybe lockdir should be ${VARDIR}/lock ??
instead of SAMBA_LOCKDIR?=         ${VARDIR}/db/samba

improve DESCR: this is 3.x, AD, what it includes ...

check #!/path/to/interpreter for /sbin/updatesmbpasswd and other scripts

--with-smbmount ?? for Linux
ln -sf $BINDIR/$p2 /sbin/mount.smbfs (I removed this in patch-aa)

? --with-acl-support      Include ACL support (default=no)

? --with-winbind          Build winbind (default, if supported by OS)

? --with-python=PYTHONNAME  build Python libraries

?? --with-libiconv

when testing, make sure work/samba-3.0.0beta3/source/include/config.h
says HAVE_LDAP is defined
 (yes with NetBSD 1.6)
 (but undefined with Linux, but did link with liblber.so)
also under NetBSD, smbd linked with libssl (why?)

check different builds and make sure the PLIST_SUBSTR is correct

Is this okay?
lib/samba/lowcase.dat
lib/samba/vfs/audit.so
FreeBSD places it to /etc; Debian places at usr/share/samba/

also set up CONFLICTS for other samba and samba20

need rc.d scripts for RCD_SCRIPTS
(maybe copy from other samba package)
