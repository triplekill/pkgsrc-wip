This needs to be converted to use new mk/krb5.buildlink3.mk.
I think it needs: KRB5_ACCEPTED=mit-krb5
but also test heimdal
samba-3.0.1/WHATSNEW.txt says:
     MIT kerberos 1.3.1 supports the ARCFOUR-HMAC-MD5 encryption 
     type which is neccessary for servers on which the 
     administrator password has not been changed, or kerberos-enabled 
     SMB connections to servers that require Kerberos SMB signing.
     Besides this one difference, either MIT or Heimdal Kerberos
     distributions are usable by Samba 3.0.

When samba version three is in real pksgrc use "samba" as directory
name (and not samba3). And maybe reimport samba as samba2?

pkglint says:
FATAL: extra item "COUNTRY_MIRRORS" placed in the DISTNAME section.
FATAL: extra item ".for COUNTRY in ${COUNTRY_MIRRORS}" placed in the DISTNAME section.
FATAL: extra item ".endfor" placed in the DISTNAME section.

test without MIT kerberos -- try with NetBSD's heimdal instead.
reminder: make a kerberos for krb 5 buildlink file

test swat

maybe lockdir should be ${VARDIR}/lock ??
instead of SAMBA_LOCKDIR?=         ${VARDIR}/db/samba

improve DESCR: this is 3.x, AD, what it includes ...

check #!/path/to/interpreter for /sbin/updatesmbpasswd and other scripts

--with-smbmount ?? for Linux
ln -sf $BINDIR/$p2 /sbin/mount.smbfs (I removed this in patch-aa)

? --with-acl-support      Include ACL support (default=no)

? --with-winbind          Build winbind (default, if supported by OS)

? --with-python=PYTHONNAME  build Python libraries

?? --with-libiconv
Add option for this. Murray Armfield says that adding libiconv buildlink
is enough to build in unicode support.

check different builds and make sure the PLIST_SUBSTR is correct
is ${SAMBA_LDAP} needed for PLIST?

is this file missing bin/pdbedit ??

Is this okay?
lib/samba/lowcase.dat
lib/samba/vfs/audit.so
FreeBSD places it to /etc; Debian places at usr/share/samba/

more testing needed for rc.d scripts

make a samba3-docs package
separate some of this out

why are all these share/examples/samba/LDAP/smbldap-tools files
installed? is this okay?

installation complained:

default smb.conf needs to be cleaned up, for example:
log file, printers

need to test

smbd links to libssl ... why?
