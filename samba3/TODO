When samba version three is in real pksgrc use "samba" as directory
name (and not samba3). And maybe reimport samba as samba2?

Update to 3.0.1.

pkglint says:
FATAL: extra item "COUNTRY_MIRRORS" placed in the DISTNAME section.
FATAL: extra item ".for COUNTRY in ${COUNTRY_MIRRORS}" placed in the DISTNAME section.
FATAL: extra item ".endfor" placed in the DISTNAME section.

test without MIT kerberos -- try with NetBSD's heimdal instead.
reminder: make a kerberos for krb 5 buildlink file

test swat

maybe lockdir should be ${VARDIR}/lock ??
instead of SAMBA_LOCKDIR?=         ${VARDIR}/db/samba

improve DESCR: this is 3.x, AD, what it includes ...

check #!/path/to/interpreter for /sbin/updatesmbpasswd and other scripts

--with-smbmount ?? for Linux
ln -sf $BINDIR/$p2 /sbin/mount.smbfs (I removed this in patch-aa)

? --with-acl-support      Include ACL support (default=no)

? --with-winbind          Build winbind (default, if supported by OS)

? --with-python=PYTHONNAME  build Python libraries

?? --with-libiconv

check different builds and make sure the PLIST_SUBSTR is correct
is ${SAMBA_LDAP} needed for PLIST?

is this file missing bin/pdbedit ??

Is this okay?
lib/samba/lowcase.dat
lib/samba/vfs/audit.so
FreeBSD places it to /etc; Debian places at usr/share/samba/

more testing needed for rc.d scripts

make a samba3-docs package
separate some of this out

why are all these share/examples/samba/LDAP/smbldap-tools files
installed? is this okay?

installation complained:
/usr/share/samba/swat/lang/ja/images/*.gif

default smb.conf needs to be cleaned up, for example:
log file, printers

need to test 3.0.1pre1

smbd links to libssl ... why?
