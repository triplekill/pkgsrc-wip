btscanner is a tool designed specifically to extract as much information as
possible from a Bluetooth device without the requirement to pair. A detailed
information screen extracts HCI and SDP information, and maintains an open
connection to monitor the RSSI and link quality. btscanner is based on the
BlueZ Bluetooth stack, which is included with recent Linux kernels, and the
BlueZ toolset.

btscanner also contains a complete listing of the IEEE OUI numbers and class
lookup tables. Using the information gathered from these sources it is
possible to make educated guesses as to the host device type.
