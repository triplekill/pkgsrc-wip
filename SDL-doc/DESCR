Simple DirectMedia Layer documentation.

This package does not contain anything by itself -- it is a
"meta-package" that depends on other SDL-doc packages.
Its sole purpose is to require dependencies so users can install
this package only and have all the SDL-doc stuff pulled in by
the port/package dependency mechanism.
