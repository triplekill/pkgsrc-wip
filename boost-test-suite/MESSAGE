Ideally, the Boost test suite will be run on a regular basis with and
without patches.  This may be accommplished with the following
crontab(5) entries.

#minute hour    mday    month   wday    command
0       2       *       *       *       ${PREFIX}/sbin/boost-test-suite
0       14      *       *       *       ${PREFIX}/sbin/boost-test-suite -p

It is important that the pkgsrc community run the test suite often as
it not only improves cross-platform support for Boost itself, but it
also improves our packages by regularly testing our pkgsrc-specific
patches and our compilers by exercising our toolchain.

Please contribute available resources to the testing so we can ensure
the best possible Boost packages.
