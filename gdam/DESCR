GDAM is a digital dj mixing software package. It aims to be a powerful,
professional-quality music mixing and remixing system, suitable for live
performance. It was conceived on some beautiful summer morning (in 1998),
and developed with drive and enthusiasm that seemed completely unnatural.
Over four years later, we have achieved many of our goals; yet, development
continues. Here is a list of features: 

* client-server architecture based around glib 
* streaming and mixing of any number of mp3 files 
* dynamic filter insertion and removal 
* multiple sound device support (see the faq) 
* plugin support 
* cacheing / playing loops 
* contiguous queueing - plays albums without gaps between songs, regardless of
  output buffer size 
* dj turntable-style interface 
* assisted beat matching 
* waveform viewer / beat calculator 
* sequencer 
* record from any point in the stream, to disk or another process 
* gtk gui's, with simple skin support 
* flexible command-line interface 
* gdam123 - an mpg123 clone that talks to a gdam server
