Razor-qt is an advanced, easy-to-use, and fast desktop environment based
on Qt technologies. It has been tailored for users who value simplicity,
speed, and an intuitive interface. Unlike most desktop environments,
Razor-qt also works fine with weak machines. It works with various WMs;
most Razor developers use Openbox.
