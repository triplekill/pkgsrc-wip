This small script lets you save the long time GNU configure script
"detecting maximum length of command-line arguments".

This utility is very simple implementation of so-called "pkgsrc database"
with command-line lenghts, proposed once upon a time on tech-pkg@ . Better
implementation could include cut-n-paste version from the configure script,
but I think this small pkg works for me (saves me time installing the same
file on many boxes).
