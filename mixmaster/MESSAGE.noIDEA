PLEASE NOTE:

This package was compiled without support for the IDEA encryption
algorithm.  Therefore, this version of Mixmaster is not capable of
communication with Type I (cypherpunk) remailers using RSA keys,
among other things.  To enable these features, re-build this package
with "PKG_OPTIONS.mixmaster=idea" set in /etc/mk.conf (requires
acceptance of the license terms for libidea).
