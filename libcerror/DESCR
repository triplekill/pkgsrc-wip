Several libraries for cross-platform C functions:

 * libcerror; error functions
 * libclocale; locale functions
 * libcnotify; notification functions
 * libcfile; file functions
 * libcpath; path functions
 * libcsplit; split string functions

These libraries were initially build to be used within other libraries and are
currently in the process of being turned into stand-alone versions.
