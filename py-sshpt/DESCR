The SSH Power Tool (sshpt) enables you to execute commands and upload files
to many servers simultaneously via SSH without using pre-shared keys.
Uploaded files and commands can be executed directly or via sudo.
Connection and command execution results are output in standard CSV
format for easy importing into spreadsheets, databases,
or data mining applications.
