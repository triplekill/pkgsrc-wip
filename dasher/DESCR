Dasher is an information-efficient text-entry interface, driven by natural
continuous pointing gestures. Dasher is a competitive text-entry system
wherever a full-size keyboard cannot be used - for example, 
* on a palmtop computer; 
* on a wearable computer; 
* when operating a computer one-handed, by joystick, touchscreen, trackball,
  or mouse; 
* when operating a computer with zero hands (i.e., by head-mouse or by
  eyetracker). 
The eyetracking version of Dasher allows an experienced user to write text
as fast as normal handwriting - 25 words per minute; using a mouse,
experienced users can write at 39 words per minute.
