Audioscrobbler builds a profile of your musical taste using a plugin
for your media player. Plugins send the name of every song you play to
the Audioscrobbler server, which updates your musical profile with the
new song. Every person with a plugin has their own page on
http://www.audioscrobbler.com which shows their listening statistics.
The system automatically matches you to people with a similar music taste,
and generates personalised recommendations.
