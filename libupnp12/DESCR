The Linux SDK for UPnP Devices v1.2 is an SDK for development of UPnP device
and control point applications for Linux.  It consists of the core UPnP
protocols along with a UPnP-specific eXtensible Markup Language (XML) parser
supporting the Document Object Model (DOM) Level 2 API and an optional,
integrated mini web server for serving UPnP related documents.
