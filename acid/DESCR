The Analysis Console for Intrusion Databases (ACID) is a PHP-based analysis 
engine to search and process a database of security events generated by 
various IDSes, firewalls, and network monitoring tools.

ACID has the ability to analyze a wide variety of events which are 
post-processed into its database. Tools exist for the following formats:
