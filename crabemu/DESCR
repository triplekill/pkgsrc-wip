CrabEmu is primarily a Sega Master System emulator for Mac OS X, Linux and Sega
Dreamcast. Several other related platforms are emulated with varying degrees of
accuracy (Game Gear and SG-1000 currently). The eventual goal of the CrabEmu
project is to emulate many different systems, and do it not only quickly, but
also accurately.

CrabEmu is designed with portability in mind. The base of CrabEmu is written in
C (specifically C99). The user interface of CrabEmu is the only part that would
actually need much porting to put CrabEmu other platforms other than Mac OS X,
Sega Dreamcast, and Linux (with Qt for the GUI).
