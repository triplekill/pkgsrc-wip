The dmapd project provides a GObject-based, Open Source DMAP server
with the following features:

    Support for both DAAP and DPAP
    Support for realtime transcoding of media formats not natively
    supported by clients
    Support for many metadata formats, such as those associated
    with Ogg Vorbis and MP3 (e.g., ID3)
    Detection of video streams so that clients may play them as
    video
    Use of GStreamer to support a wide range of audio and video
    CODECs
    Caching of photograph thumbnails to avoid regenerating them
    each time the server restarts

Dmapd runs on Linux and other POSIX operating systems. It has been
used on OpenWrt Linux-based systems with as little as 32MB of memory
to serve music, video and photograph libraries containing thousands
of files.
