SPADE (Smart Python multi-Agent Development Environment) is a Multiagent and
Organizations Platform based on the XMPP/Jabber technology and written in the
Python programming language. This technology offers by itself many features and
facilities that ease the construction of MAS, such as an existing communication
channel, the concepts of users (agents) and servers (platforms) and an
extensible communication protocol based on XML, just like FIPA-ACL. Many other
agent platforms exist, but SPADE is the first to base its roots on
the XMPP technology
