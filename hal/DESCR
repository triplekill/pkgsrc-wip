HAL is simply just a piece of user-space software that maintains a list
of device with well-defined properties for each device. In addition, HAL
provides space for application defined properties per device.

HAL is *not* concerned with how to use the hardware, nor is HAL concerned
with configuring the hardware. However, HAL can be used in applications that
needs the hardware by providing the list of devices and space for storing
configuration values.
