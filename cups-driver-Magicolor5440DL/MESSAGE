The CUPS driver for the Konica Minolta Magicolor 5440DL requires
ghostscript to be compiled with cups support (which is off by default).

This can be achieved by setting:

	PKG_OPTIONS.ghostscript+=cups

inside /etc/mk.conf, and then reinstall ghostscript package.

Consider also uncommenting the following line in cups configuration file
${PKG_SYSCONFDIR}/cups/mime.convs to add the correct MIME type support for
the filter:

#application/octet-stream	application/vnd.cups-raw	0	-
