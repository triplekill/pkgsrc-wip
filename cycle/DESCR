Cycle is a calendar program for women. Given a cycle length or statistics for
several periods, it can calculate the days until menstruation, the days of
"safe" sex, the fertile period, and the days to ovulations, and define the
d.o.b. (date of birth) of a child. It allows the user to write notes and
helps to supervise the reception of hormonal contraceptive tablets.
