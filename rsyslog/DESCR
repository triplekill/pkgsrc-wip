Rsyslog is an enhanced multi-threaded syslogd supporting, among
others, MySQL, PgSQL, syslog/tcp, RFC 3195, permitted sender lists,
filtering on any message part, and fine grain output format control.
It is quite compatible to stock sysklogd and can be used as a
drop-in replacement. Its advanced features make it suitable for
enterprise-class, encryption protected syslog relay chains while
at the same time being very easy to setup for the novice user. An
optional web interface - phpLogCon - can be used to visualize all
data online.
