Katapult is a KDE application that provides you with faster and easier
access to your applications, bookmarks, and more. It is plugin-based and
can launch anything it has a plugin for. Its plugin-driven appearance is
completely customizable. Katapult was inspired by Quicksilver for OS X,
and it is written in C++.
