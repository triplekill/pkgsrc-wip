Ditz is a simple, light-weight distributed issue tracker designed to
work with distributed version control systems like darcs and git. Ditz
maintains an issue database file on disk, written in a line-based and
human-editable format. This file can be kept under version control
alongside project code, and issue state change can then be handled
like code changes: modified as part of a commit, merged with other
state changes from other developers, conflict-resolved in the standard
manner, etc.

Ditz provides a simple, console-based interface for creating and
updating the issue database file, and some rudimentary HTML generation
capabilities for producing world-readable status pages. It offers no
central public method of bug submission.
