From project's WWW page:

Additional features over cvsweb:
  * Template support: you can now customize the look and feel of ViewCVS
    by editing the provided EZT templates, which are used to generate the 
    pages.
  * Internationalization support: ViewCVS will parse and handle the
    Accept-Language request header, and can select different inputs for
    localized page generation.
  * Colorization for many file types via enscript.
  * Bonsai-like query features. (Requires MySQL and some other prerequisites)
  * Annotation/blame viewing support against a read-only repository.
  * Configuration on a per-virtual-host basis. This allows you to
    share the configuration file and ViewCVS installation across virtual hosts,
    yet still be able to fine-tune the options when necessary.

... and more!
