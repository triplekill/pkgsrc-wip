Java Platform, Micro Edition (Java ME) provides a robust, flexible
environment for applications running on mobile and other embedded
devices set-top boxes, and printers. Java ME includes flexible user
interfaces, robust security, built-in network protocols, and support
for networked and offline applications that can be downloaded
dynamically. Applications based on Java ME are portable across many
devices, yet leverage each device's native capabilities.
