The primary goal of the Network UPS Tools (NUT) project is to provide
reliable monitoring of UPS hardware and ensure safe shutdowns of the
systems which are connected.

Network communications are used so that multiple systems can monitor a
single physical UPS and shut down together if necessary without any
special "sharing hardware" on the UPS itself.
