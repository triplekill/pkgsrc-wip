Pyntch is a Python code analyzer. It can detect possible runtime errors
before actually running a Python code. Pyntch examines a source code statically
and infers all possible types of variables, class attributes, function
signatures, and return values of each function or method. Then it detects
possible errors caused by type mismatch or other exceptions raised from each
function. Unlike other Python code checker (such as Pychecker or Pyflakes),
Pyntch does not check the style issues
