Redland  is  a  library  that  provides a high-level interface for RDF
allowing  the  RDF  graph  to  be parsed from XML, stored, queried and
manipulated.  Redland  implements  each of the RDF concepts in its own
class  via an object based API, reflected into the other language APIs
- Java, Perl, PHP, Python, Ruby and Tcl. Some of the classes providing
the  parsers,  storage  mechanisms  and  other  elements  are built as
modules that can be added or removed as required.

Redland provides:
     * A modular, object based library written in C
     * Java,  Perl, PHP, Python, Ruby and Tcl interfaces for manipulating
       the RDF graph and parts - Statements, Resources and Literals
     * Parsers and Serializers for reading and writing RDF as syntax.
     * Storage  for  graphs in memory and on disk via Sleepcat / Berkeley
       DB.
     * Query  APIs  for  the graph by Statement (triples) or by Nodes and
       Arcs
     * Statement  Streams  for construction, parsing, de/serialisation of
       graphs
     * Start of query language support.
     * No memory leaks so far.
