Khal is a CLI (console), CalDAV based calendar programm, allowing
syncing of calendars with a variety of other programs on a host of
different platforms.

khal is currently in a very early stage of development, has a very
limited feature set and is probably full of bugs. If you still want
to take it out for a spin, please know, that as long as you don't
enable write support, there is no chance at all that you might mess
up your remote calendar. If you do try it out, please report back
any bugs you might encounter.
