pkg_status utility can do the following things:
  - fast check the version of installed packages against the pkgsrc source
    tree or pkg_summary.{txt,gz,bz} file.
  - find leaf packages, i.e., packages installed automatically unneeded
    by other packages and optionally remove them.
  - do some kind of sanity checks for installed packages

"Of course it is based on pkg_summary-utils" :-)
