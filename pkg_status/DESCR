pkg_status utility checks the version of each installed package
against the pkgsrc source tree or pkg_summary.{txt,gz,bz} file.
'pkg_status -s' (checking against pkgsrc source tree) is
a drammatically faster and more powerful replacement
for 'lintpkgsrc -i'.

Of course it is based on pkg_summary-utils ;-)
