Version 0.13, by Aleksey Cheusov, Wed, 29 Dec 2010 17:48:20 +0200

  Option -c was added in order check CONFLICTS

======================================================================
Version 0.12, by Aleksey Cheusov, Sat, 25 Dec 2010 17:22:37 +0200

  Option -T was added in order to show whether packages were installed
  by user or as a dependencies.

  Output was slightly improved

======================================================================
Version 0.11, by Aleksey Cheusov, Sun, 14 Nov 2010 02:40:05 +0200

  Licence has been changed from MIT to functionally equivalent
  2-clause-BSD.

  fix: If -b and -s are applied multiple times,
  the later must be used.

  -Q option has been renamed to -q. -Q is still supported by will be
   removed in the future.

======================================================================
Version 0.10, by Aleksey Cheusov, Fri, 29 Oct 2010 01:06:37 +0300

  New option -0 was added. If it is applied, on NetBSD, Linux, FreeBSD
  and OpenBSD, 'pkg_status -s' runs as much subprocesses as CPUs the
  computer has thus drammatically reducing total time on SMP
  systems. See PSS_SLAVES variable for changing this behaviour of
  disabling it.

  Options listed in PKG_STATUS_OPTIONS environment variable are
  automatically passed to pkg_status, e.g. -0.

  FIX: On Linux, Solaris, Interix and some other platforms xargs
  stupidly runs the specified application even if there is no any
  input. As a result pkg_status -l[RE] may fail.

  New suboption -L for option -k was added for checking that all files
  listed in REQUIRES exist.

  Documentation update, see pkg_status -h

  mktemp(1) is used for creating a temporary directory.

======================================================================
Version 0.9.0, by Aleksey Cheusov, Sat,  5 Jun 2010 00:41:42 +0300

  New option -k for "sanity checks" of installed packages.
     -kU - REQUIRES/PROVIDES coherence
     -kd - existance of required dependencies
     -km - 'pkg_admin check'

======================================================================
Version 0.8.0, by Aleksey Cheusov, Mon, 31 May 2010 15:01:42 +0300

  New options:
   -l, -lt, -lr         faster replacement for pkg_leaves
   -lR, -lE             for removing automatically installed
                        leaf packages
   -l[RE]n              -n is passed to pkg_delete
   -V                   display version

======================================================================
Version 0.7.1, by Aleksey Cheusov, Fri, 19 Mar 2010 14:43:05 +0200

  fix for dash, seen on Debian

======================================================================
Version 0.7, by Aleksey Cheusov, Wed, 17 Mar 2010 12:07:00 +0200

  -p option has been added. Sample of usage:
     pkg_info -u -QPKGPATH > /etc/really_needed_packages.txt
     # Lots of pkg_add, pkg_delete...
     pkg_status -sp /etc/really_needed_packages.txt

  `>>>' and `---' have been replaced with `>' and `-'

  pkg_status now has its own Makefile

======================================================================
Version 0.6, by Aleksey Cheusov, Sun, 14 Mar 2010 11:25:48 +0200

  Implementation for option -b
     (comparison with pkg_summary.{txt,gz,bz2})

  In order to avoid conflicts with FreeBSD and OpenBSD native pkg_info
  utility, path to pkgsrc pkg_info is kept in pkg_status source file.

  fix: with -r stupid banner should not be showed,
  that is -r implies -Q

  Alternative to pkg_micro_src_summary utility is set by
  PKG_SRC_SUMMARY_CMD variable.
