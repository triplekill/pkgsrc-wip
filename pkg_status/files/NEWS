Version 0.7, by Aleksey Cheusov, Wed, 17 Mar 2010 12:07:00 +0200

  -p option has been added. Sample of usage:
     pkg_info -u -QPKGPATH > /etc/really_needed_packages.txt
     # Lots of pkg_add, pkg_delete...
     pkg_status -sp /etc/really_needed_packages.txt

  `>>>' and `---' have been replaced with `>' and `-'

  pkg_status now has its own Makefile

======================================================================
Version 0.6, by Aleksey Cheusov, Sun, 14 Mar 2010 11:25:48 +0200

  Implementation for option -b
     (comparison with pkg_summary.{txt,gz,bz2})

  In order to avoid conflicts with FreeBSD and OpenBSD native pkg_info
  utility, path to pkgsrc pkg_info is kept in pkg_status source file.

  fix: with -r stupid banner should not be showed,
  that is -r implies -Q

  Alternative to pkg_micro_src_summary utility is set by
  PKG_SRC_SUMMARY_CMD variable.
