PyWM is a Python Window Manager.

You drive PYWM by creating a subclass of the basic pywm.WM window manager
class. If you want even more per-window control, you can subclass the
pywm.window class as well. Plenty of examples in the PYWM distribution you
can use as a starting point.

In contrast to other Python-driven window managers, this one is so easy and
intuitive that you'll be hacking your own window manager script in a couple
of minutes. A set of easily-undersood example scripts is included with the
distribution.
