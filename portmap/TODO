What package should provide rpcinfo tool? (It is in glibc package.)
maybe for DESCR: (The rpcinfo command included in the **** package can
tell you what RPC services your system offers.)

need simple man pages some day
look at man page include with NetBSD

test under NetBSD and other operating systems

figure out pidfile and location (for rc.d script)

don't hardcode /usr/lib in patch-aa
+WRAP_DIR= /usr/lib
