A small package that installs basic dependencies and support so that
one can very quickly setup a NetBSD CVS Tree mirror server.  Based
on FreeBSD's port of identical name with some improvements.

Released in the interest of furthering the use of CVSUP as a
faster alternative to CVS Checkouts (Note: pkgsrc-wip has
full CVSUp checkout support from cvsup.netbsd.se)
