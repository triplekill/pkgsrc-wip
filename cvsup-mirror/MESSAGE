$NetBSD$
To setup your shiny new CVSUp mirror:

 * Make a symlink within %PREFIX%/etc/cvsup/prefixes for
   directiory ../ -> NetBSD-distrib.self/

   e.g., % cd /usr/pkg/etc/cvsup/prefixes && ln -s ../ ./NetBSD-distrib.self

 * Make a symlink within %PREFIX%/etc/cvsup/prefixes for
   directory /export/netbsd/cvs -> ./NetBSD.cvs

   e.g., % cd %PREFIX%/etc/cvsup/prefixes &&
	ln -s /export/netbsd/cvs ./NetBSD-CVS

 * NOTE: This package ships with a NetBSD client CVSUP supfile that
   will fetch the "NetBSD-distrib.self" repository from cvsup.jp.netbsd.org;
   these sup files are actually a collection on cvsupd(8) config files that work
   in combination with the full CVS tree mirror.

   They will reference a full NetBSD CVS tree in path /home/cvsroot ; please
   ensure that /home/cvsroot is also symlink'd the path of your CVS
   repository such as the /export/netbsd/cvs above.

 * Make sure you have two POSIX [user:group] pairs setup, normally:
   [cvsupin:cvsupin] to run the upgrade script and own all CVS
   repositories, and [cvsup:cvsup] to run the cvsupd(8) service daemon.

 * Setup your cvsupd(8) configuration in rc.conf(5); by default it will
   serve known 'collections' listed in %PREFIX%/etc/cvsup/sup which will
   be populated by the initial manual synchronization via the
   NetBSD-distrib.self prefix symlink

 * Run an initial manual synchronization:

   e.g., %PREFIX%/etc/cvsup/update.sh netbsd

 * Setup a cronjob schedule agreeable to your bandwidth such as:

   15 0-12,14-23 * * * /usr/pkg/etc/cvsup/update.sh netbsd -s
   15 13 * * * /usr/pkg/etc/cvsup/update.sh netbsd # run it 1/day w/o scanfiles

 * Monitor your mirror for freshness using your NMS!
