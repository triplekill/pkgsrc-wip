Raw photo loader plugin for the GIMP.  This plugin incorporates dcraw
(also available as pkgsrc/graphics/dcraw) to convert a digital camera
raw file to an image, and then loads the image into the GIMP.  This
plugin is more featureful thatn the "rawphoto" plugin, and in
particular shows histograms and supports tone curves.  This plugin
does not load EXIF data from the raw file into the GIMP.
