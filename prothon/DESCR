Prothon is a fresh new language that gets rid of classes altogether in the
same way that Self does and regains the original practical and fun
sensibility of Python. This major improvement plus many minor ones make for
a clean new revolutionary break in language development. Prothon is quite
simple and yet offers the power of Python and Self.

Prothon is also an industrial-strength alternative to Python and Self.
Prothon uses native threads and a 64-bit architecture to maximize
performance in applications such as multiple-cpu hosting.
