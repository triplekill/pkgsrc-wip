pysage is a high-level message passing library supporting actor based
concurrency. It also extends the "actor model" to support actor
partitioning/grouping to further scalability. pysage has a simple
high-level interface. Messages are serialized and sent light-weight using
pipes or domain sockets across local "groups". In the case of network messages,
UDP is used.

    * simple pythonic API
    * efficient message propagation within group, across group, across network
    * network messages can optionally be configured to be reliable
       and/or ordered using UDP
    * grouping - actors can be partitioned into groups that are run in
       separate os processes
    * process-local singleton manager - actor registration, discovery,
       message propagation
    * publisher/subscriber pattern built-in
