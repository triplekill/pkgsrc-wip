complete. My understanding of Makefile/pkglint may not be up to snuff so some
warnings may need to be fixed.

I glommed the dependency out of the CPAN require/use clauses in the installed
.pm, since the CPAN for Digest::MD5 was already installed and so it wasn't
an 'unsatisfied' dependency before I began.
