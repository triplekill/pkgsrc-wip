Mystic is written in python, and relies on numpy for several of it's
data structures. The plotting package matplotlib is not required by mystic,
however several of mystic's tutorial examples do require it to be installed.
Note that although the tutorial examples are bundled with the distribution, they
are not installed as a package.
