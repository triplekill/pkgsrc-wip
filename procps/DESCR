The Linux /proc file system utilities are tools for reporting about
and modifying the state of the system, including memory, processes,
sending signals to processes, etc. The commands include free, oldps,
pgrep, pkill, ps, skill, snice, sysctl, tload, top, vmstat, w and watch.
(kill is not installed; it is available in the sysutils/util-linux
package.)

This version of procps is maintained by Albert Cahalan, based on
original code from Michael K. Johnson.
