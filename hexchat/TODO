(*) dbus options stalls here:

Making all in dbus
/bin/sh ../../../libtool --mode=execute /usr/pkgsrc/pkg/bin/glib-genmarshal  --header --body  > marshallers.h
^Cbmake: *** marshallers.h removed

(*) themes option fails like this:

   /usr/pkgsrc/dev/wip/hexchat/work/hexchat-2.9.6.1/src/htm/Main.cs(30,17):
   error CS0234: The type or namespace name `Packaging' does not exist in the
   namespace `System.IO'. Are you missing an assembly reference?

(*) libpci option doesn't seem to allow other plugins to load. Without this
option, one can see the list of plugins loading upon execution. With the plugin,
that display is absent, even in the Plugins dialogue window.
