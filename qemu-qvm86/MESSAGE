In order to use the x86 acceleration features, you must get the LKM
loaded at system boot time. To do so, put this line into /etc/lkm.conf:
	/usr/pkg/lib/qemu/qvm86.o - - /usr/pkg/share/qemu/qvm86.sh - -

Also, put this line into /etc/rc.conf:
	lkm=yes

WARNING! Before you load the kernel module you should be aware
that some code runs at kernel privilege. This code has not
been audited for security problems. It is important that access
to /dev/kqemu is limited. The above example only allows members
of the wheel group to use acceleration.
Bugs in the kernel module can potentially allow the guest environment
to break out of it's virtual sandbox. Don't run binaries you
don't trust.

Currently, the only OS that boots to multiuser is Linux.
