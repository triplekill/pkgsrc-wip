Core dumps for me on NetBSD-6.99.15/amd64 after adding media -- wiz 20121203

More portable solution for uuid code should be found (see
patch*librygel*); using the libuuid package doesn't currently work
because of net/gupnp/buildlink3.mk's trying to overwrite uuid.pc.

Config file framework should be used.
pkgsrc user/group handling should be used.
rc.d script should be added.
