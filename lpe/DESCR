LPE is a small, efficient programmer's editor for UNIX systems.  It has grown
from the result of a single night of hacking into a very capable and very
versatile editor that defines it's own philosophy opf text editing.  That
philosophy is that awk and sed are the right tools for most advanced editing
jobs, and a text editor should make simple operations easy and make text look
good.
