reSID is a reverse engineered software emulation of the MOS6581 SID.
This chip was used in the Commodore 64 computer.

This is a snapshot from libSIDPlay2 CVS combined with some
portability fixes and patches to make sure it builds at least
on various Linux distributions, Solaris 9 (you need gcc3, etc)
and NetBSD. These improvements have made by ccr/TNSP.
