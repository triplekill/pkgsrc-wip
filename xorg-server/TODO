This needs to have these available.
They are probably all different distfiles.
For examples, please see the other related wip/*proto* files.
(Note that the buildlink3.mk files to be made are probably all

fixesproto

Need a PLIST.
Need to add the needed includes for buildlink3.mk files to Makefile.
Note that package name is same but versioning goes to lower number.
