 You can use ch or chs (Ch interpreters: normal and safe variant)
 as login shells.

 If you install Ch, please run the command ch -d to create a Ch startup
 configuration file in your home directory, if it is the first time to run
 Ch. To get started for Ch, you can run the command help in a Ch shell. Read
 Online documentation for more information.

 Getting started in Ch, type

  setenv CHHOME ${EMULOPTDIR}/ch4.0.0/

 if you use csh, or

  export CHHOME="${EMULOPTDIR}/ch4.0.0/"

 if you use (ba)sh. Then execute:

  ${EMULOPTDIR}/ch4.0.0/bin/ch

  help
