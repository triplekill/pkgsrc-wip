- Perhaps add the X11 GUI support? (This doesn't compile yet, though)

--

1) Replace GNU_CONFIGURE= no with HAS_CONFIGURE.
2) We don't need to put the CONFIGURE_ARGS with --bindir, --datadir, etc
     pkgsrc will do it.
3) Patch the configure script and replace the harcoded PATHS with PREFIX
     or X11BASE in the right place.
4) Add USE_X11 to the Makefile.
