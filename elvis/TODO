- Perhaps add the X11 GUI support? (This doesn't compile yet, though)

--

Questions remaining:
1) We don't need to put the CONFIGURE_ARGS with --bindir, --datadir, etc
     pkgsrc will do it.
2) Patch the configure script and replace the harcoded PATHS with PREFIX
     or X11BASE in the right place.
3) Add USE_X11 to the Makefile.

This last is only when the GUI is built.
