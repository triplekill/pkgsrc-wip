The usual way to inspect a stacktrace of a program is to use an external
debugger such as gdb and its command 'bt'.  However, sometimes it is useful
to obtain a stacktrace from within a program, e.g., for the purposes of
logging, debugging or diagnostics.

libstacktrace library provides stacktrace(3) function that have the same
API/usage as glibc's backtrace(3) but works at least under NetBSD, FreeBSD
and Solaris.
