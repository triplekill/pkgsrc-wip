1) Fix and update Fortran support in pkgsrc to enable
   different compilers with FC and PKGSRC_FORTRAN. See
   http://mail-index.netbsd.org/tech-toolchain/2011/11/26/msg001789.html 
   for instance. Currently this package uses GCC_REQD=4.7.0
   and builds lang/gcc47 if not already installed. If
   FC or PKGSRC_FORTRAN are set, it will fail. The default
   compiler in pkgsrc is f2c for USE_LANGUAGES=fortran77 and
   g95 for USE_LANGUAGES=fortran. Lapack needs Fortran90
   excluding F2C, and g95 development has stopped more than
   a year ago. Therefor lang/gcc47 seems to be the only
   alternative. Additionally LAPACK now contains a new
   standard LAPACKE for interfacing with C99 or C++ which
   has explicit support for gfortran/gcc.

2) Find a consensus on default options: BLAS, TESTING,
   optimization flags,  VARIANTS, LAPACKE C interface, 
   libtool options as needed by the packages using it:
   R, octave at least and do lots of testing on different
   operating systems.

3) Fix buildlink3.mk
