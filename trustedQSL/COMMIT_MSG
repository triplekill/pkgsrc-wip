2.0.1RC3, 2014/01/13 (but hangs when reading cert_status.xml)
Two additional changes in TQSL 2.0 RC3:
  -------------
  A. Because new modes may not yet be specified in ADIF, and because
  LoTW may not accept all modes specified in ADIF, TQSL enables you to
  "map" a new mode to a mode or mode group recognized by LoTW; this
  most often takes the form of mapping a new digital mode to the DATA
  mode group. Versions of TQSL prior to 2.0 would allow you to map
  modes accepted by LoTW. This version of TQSL will refuse to map a
  mode that is accepted by LoTW. Any existing mappings of modes
  accepted by LoTW will be automatically removed on startup; you will
  be notified if this happens.
  
  B. When submitting log files in Cabrillo format, previous versions of
  TQSL submitted FM and PH modes as PHONE. TQSL 2.0 RC2 submits FM mode
  as FM, and PH mode as SSB.
