- 1.14.3 shows 
  Final Status: Commmand Syntax Error(10)
  with the -h or --help option. I'm asking developper if this is
  intended behavior or not.
- Set LICENSE= line
- Checked with X11_TYPE=modular only for now
- Following SUBST_CLASSES are all to be applied
  post-build stage, probably cmake related problem.
  Should be eliminated: 
   SUBST_CLASSES+=		x11r7	   (X11_TYPE= modular only)
   SUBST_CLASSES+=		rpath-link
   SUBST_CLASSES+=		lastcolon
