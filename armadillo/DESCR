Armadillo is an open-source C++ linear algebra library (matrix maths) aiming
towards a good balance between speed and ease of use. Integer, floating point
and complex numbers are supported, as well as a subset of trigonometric and
statistics functions. Various matrix decompositions are provided through
optional integration with LAPACK, or one of its high performance drop-in
replacements (such as MKL or ACML).
