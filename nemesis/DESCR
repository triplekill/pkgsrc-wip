The Nemesis Project is designed to be a commandline-based, portable human IP
stack for UNIX/Linux.  The suite is broken down by protocol, and should allow
for useful scripting of injected packet streams from simple shell scripts.

Key Features:

+ ARP/RARP, DNS, ICMP, IGMP, OSPF, RIP, TCP, UDP protocol support
+ Layer 2 or Layer 3 injection (by presence/absence of -d <dev> switch)
+ Packet Payload from file
+ tested on OpenBSD, NetBSD, FreeBSD, Solaris/Trusted Solaris, Linux,
  and Mac OS X
+ Supplied with OpenBSD 2.9 kernel patch (./openbsd/RAW4ALL-2.9.patch)
  with Nemesis modifications to launch packets as a normal user.
