A mutt query_command utility is included with the rolo package. This
utility will allow queries to the data file (defaults to
~/.rolo/contacts.vcf) from mutt using mutt's query_command (see muttrc(5)
for more info). In order to get this to work, you must add the following
line to your ~/.muttrc file after installing the rolo package:

set query_command="mutt_vc_query '%s'"

And you will then be able to query email addresses from the data file when
you use the `Q' command in mutt.
