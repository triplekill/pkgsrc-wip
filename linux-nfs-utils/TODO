Need to update to new version because of security issue.

is my DESCR too long?

use PKG_SYSCONFDIR

set a VARDIR config for /var/lib/nfs (and use in mountd script)

# the readme says: Proper NFS operation requires a 'mount' program
from util-linux 2.11f or later.

# The state directory is /var/lib/nfs.
# This package creates /var/lib/nfs/{xtab,etab,rmtab} directories
# but doesn't remove them on deinstallation.

# nhfsgraph uses graph(1) which is provided by graphics/plotutils
# but graphics/plotutils is not a DEPENDS and may not be installed.
- I added a MESSAGE about this
- This package has a known vulnerability, please investigate and fix if possible. (see: CVE-2008-4552).
