This is the Linux NFS utility package. This software includes:

- exportfs - management of NFS exported file systems.
- rpc.lockd - the NFS lock manager (if needed).
- rpc.mountd - the NFS mount daemon for exporting file systems. It has
  TCP Wrappers support.
- rpc.nfsd - NFS server process.
- rpc.rquotad - returns quotas for a user of a local file system
  which is mounted by a remote machine over the NFS.
- rpc.statd - status monitor server for the NSM (Network Status
  Monitor) RPC protocol. This also has TCP Wrappers protection.
- nfsstat - reports NFS (and RPC) stats for server and client.
- nhfsstone - used on an NFS client to generate an artificial load.
- nhfsrun - a shell script for running nhfsstone over multiple load
  levels.
- nhfsnums - uses the nhfsrun output and converts it to plot(5) format.
- nhfsgraph - uses that nhfsnums output and produces a Postscript
  graph using graph(1). Install the graphics/plotutils package to
  use it.
- showmount - list the clients mounting from the NFS server or show
  other mount information.
