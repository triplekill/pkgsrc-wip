New feature for gdsreader-0.3.2 

  Generation of POVRAY scene files.

Quick Overview:

GDS2, (or "Calma"), files contain 2D shape data, and each shape has
a specific layer number, (gdsno), and a datatype number.  To  make
any sort of 3D model, these two integer numbers must be  "mapped"
to a corresponding thickness and depth parameter, and  also to a
color specification.   This  is handled by the user-created
"layers.config" file.  A  layers.config file needs to be made for
each technology you wish to convert.  A process which differs only
in the number of metal layers used is considered a different
technology.  The layers.config file is also used in the generation
of postscript and HPGL output, so several of the parameters in 
a layers.config file do not necessarily apply to POVRAY output.
