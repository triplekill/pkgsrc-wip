- Told next release in end of November (2014)
- This package is partly broken because building qt5-qtwebkit breaks 
NetBSD 6. The reason is that NetBSD 6 does not have execinfo.h but 
NetBSD current have this. This package does build and run on 
NetBSD 6 if execinfo.h is not included in the file 
qtwebkit/Source/WTF/wtf/Assertions.cpp in qt5-qtwebkit.
