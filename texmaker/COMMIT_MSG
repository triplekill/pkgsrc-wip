update 4.3. to 4.4.1 
( Release note at http://www.xm1math.net/texmaker/log.html )

version 4.4 -> 4.4.1 :
Bugs fixed :
- a crash if the "% !TEX encoding=" meta tag is not valid has been fixed
- a bug related to some shorctuts (ctrl+shift+?) has been fixed

Note :
The macosx Lion/Mountain/Maverick package is again compiled with Qt
5.2.1 (two much issues with Qt 5.3.2 webkit and macdeployqt on MacOsX
>=10.10)

version 4.3 -> 4.4 :
Features :
- a new wizard for a standard XeLaTeX document has been added
- a script ("User" menu to execute it) to apply a hard word wrap at 80
  columns to the selected text has been added (will work like the php
  wordwrap() function - just change the textwidth value in the script
  if you need another value)
- the list of furnished scripts is displayed in the "Run Script"
  sub-menu of the "User" menu (if a script is located at the same
  place than the furnished scripts, it will appear automtically in
  this menu)
- support for the meta tags "% !TEX encoding=" and "% !TEX spellcheck"
  has been added (the meta tag "% !TEX root" is already supported)
- .vrb,.listing and .spx extensions have been added to the "Clean"
  command (users requests)
- cs, de, el, hu, pl, ru, se and vi translations have been updated
  (thanks to all the translators)

Bugs fixed :
- the xelatex command is now included in the "Tools" menu
- a bad behavior when spelling the document while a text is selected
  has been fixed (issue 1393)

Note :
- The windows versions are now compiled with poppler 0.26.
- The macosx Lion/Mountain/Maverick package is now compiled with Qt
  5.3.2 and poppler 0.26
- The obsolete macosx 32 bits version is no more furnished (the 4.3
  version will stay available on the download page)
