# There are several versions of guile; the relevant ones for this
# module are 1.6.x, which is the current FSF version, and ttn-1.4,
# which is a forked version of 1.4 by Thien-Thi Nguyen, the maintainer
# of guile-pg.  fsf-1.4 is considered obsolete by nearly everyone.

# In 1.6 (but not fsf-1.4 or ttn-1.4), binary modules are deprecated.
# guile-pg uses binary modules, and places them and scheme code in
# $GUILE_LIBSITE, which is searched by ttn-1.4, but not by 1.6.  The
# simplest nonproblematic solution is to symlink the installed code to
# where 1.6 expects it.  We could patch guile-pg to install in 1.6's
# preferred location ${PREFIX}/share/guile/site, but there is a shared
# library which of course cannot go in share.

post-install:
	# guile should make this, but if not
	${INSTALL_DATA_DIR} ${PREFIX}/share/guile/site
	cd ${PREFIX}/share/guile/site && ${LN} -sf ../../../lib/guile/site/database .
