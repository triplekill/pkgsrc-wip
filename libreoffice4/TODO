* Enable font/harfbuzz's icu option by default.
* More system libraries.

Works properly on:
* NetBSD/amd64 6.99.23 with native X
* NetBSD/amd64 6.1 with native X
* NetBSD/i386 6.1 with native X

Does not work properly on
* NetBSD/i386 5.2 with modular X ... opening preference window causes SIGFPE.
