EDoc++ is a tool that analyses exception usage in C++ source code to provide
compile time/static analysis checks similar to that found in other languages
such as Java. EDoc++ can also generate detailed information about exception
propagation in various formats. One of which can be used by doxygen in
documenting exception information for API's.
