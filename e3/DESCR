e3 (200k) is a full featured text editor in three versions: primary e3
for x86 versions of Linux, FreeBSD, NetBSD, OpenBSD, Win9x, QNX, Atheos,
BeOS(TM), DOS and ELKS (ELKS == Embeddable Linux Kernel Subset) written
in NASM assembler, for second a version for ARM Risc CPUs and for third
e3c, a C equivalent for all other platforms, for example on other RISC
CPU like ALPHA. The assembler version is highly optimized for size.

For the command syntax you can choice between the families of
Wordstar(TM), EMACS, Pico, nedit or vi editors. In Linux the e3
uncompressed executable's size is at 12000 byte, a compressed executable
will need around 9000 byte, so you won't waste your disk space ;-) e3 is
quite independent of libc and because of its size it is very usable for
Mini-Linux distributions and rescue disks. e3 has a numeric calculator
built in. Newer e3 versions have the UNDO feature built in. Some
features like piping through /bin/sed (using stream editor as a sub
process) are currently designed for Linux and *BSD only, anyway this
opens e3's door to the world of regular expressions.  The 16 bit
assembler versions of e3 and the C version are limited to Wordstar keys
only.
