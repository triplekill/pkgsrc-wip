This is my program ncps. When you run it, you basically see the same thing that
you see when you run ps, except for the fact that you can now move up and down 
a highlight to the process you want to kill. It can also display processes in 
tree form, and you can search for processes that contain a user specified 
string.

festures:

    * you can issue arbitrary command to a process. Trees are now collapsible.
    * you can kill a group of selected processes.
    * regexp support in search mode
