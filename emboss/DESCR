EMBOSS stands for "The European Molecular Biology Open Software Suite"
and is  a new, free Open Source software analysis  package specially
developed for the needs of  the molecular biology (e.g. EMBnet) user
community. The software automatically copes with data in a variety of
formats and even allows transparent retrieval of sequence data from
the web. Also, as extensive  libraries are provided with the  package,
it is a platform to allow other scientists to  develop and  release
software  in true open  source spirit.  EMBOSS also  integrates a
range  of currently available packages and tools for sequence analysis
into a seamless whole.
