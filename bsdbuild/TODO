-- We really should edit all of the included mk files, etc.
   to best integrate with pkgsrc.  This package is quite rough
   around the edges at the moment!  Please feel free to work on it.

-- There are still absolute path names in it; that ought to have changed in
   the current bsdbuild release. This is the latest stable release.

-- Might there still be /usr/pkg needed then use the sed(1) patterns
   to change them.
