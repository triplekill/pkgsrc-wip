* Fix some compile issues that are raised
  - surpress openssl related warnings.  - emacs with openssl support requires
    more work outside the scope of this package ( and additional elisp package)
    emacs-current has this support
  - fix other erc related errors 
   
  
  
* Fix the 2 errors shown by pkglint. These errors seem to be existant in all
  packages using emacs.mk ?
   These warnings are :
   WARN: "BUILD_DEPENDS" has to appear earlier.
   WARN: "DEPENDS" has to appear earlier.
  Perhaps fix emacs.mk to solve these?
