This is mate-calc, a fork of gnome-calc, the calculator application that was
previously in the OpenWindows Deskset of the Solaris 8 operating system.

It incorporates a multiple precision arithmetic packages based on the work
of Professor Richard Brent, who has also kindly given me permission to make
it available.

There is a single graphics driver for Gtk2 included with this release.
