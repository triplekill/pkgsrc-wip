Ispell is a fast screen-oriented spelling checker that shows you your errors in
the context of the original file, and suggests possible corrections when it can
figure them out.

This package does not contain anything by itself - it is a "meta-package" that
depends on other aspell packages. Its sole purpose is to require dependencies so
users can install this package only and have all the ispell stuff (or what is
set in PKG_OPTIONS.ispell-dictionaries) pulled in by the package dependency
mechanism.
