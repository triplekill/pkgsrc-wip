- Merge this package into the www/mozilla framework?  To be honest; I tried
  that, and it's a mess.  The package didn't work.  This one does.  So for now
  I'll keep it here in pkgsrc-wip for the people who want it.  Anyway it would
  be nice if it were possible to install e.g. -gtk2 and -qt3 packages
  concurrently.

- Can we --enable-official-branding by default? (ask the Mozilla Foundation)
