Vertex is an implementation of the Q2Q protocol (sort of like P2P, but one
better). There are a few moving parts in Vertex:

 - PTCP: a protocol which is nearly identical to TCP, but which runs over UDP.
   This lets Q2Q penetrate most NAT configurations.

 - JUICE ([JU]ice [I]s [C]oncurrent [E]vents): a very simple but immensely
   flexible protocol which forms the basis of the high-level aspects of Q2Q

 - vertex: a command line tool which exposes a few features useful in many
   situations (such as registration and authentication)
