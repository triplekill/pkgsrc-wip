KPlayer is a multimedia player for the K Desktop Environment.

KPlayer uses MPlayer as the media playing backend, and therefore offers
the best playback quality and performance and the widest variety of
supported video, audio and subtitle formats, input methods and output
options. Specifically, MPlayer supports playing from local files, DVDs,
video CDs, audio CDs, TV and DVB cards, as well as network locations
using many types of protocols.

However, KPlayer is much more that just an MPlayer frontend. In
addition to KDE integration and an easy to use interface that follows
KDE standards, it offers a simple but full featured playlist, many
additional input methods using KDE I/O Slaves, and last but not least
the ability to easily choose many different options for each individual
file or URL, giving you flexibility not found in any other media player.
