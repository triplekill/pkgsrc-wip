Editres  is a tool that allows users and application developers to view
the full widget hierarchy of any X Toolkit application that speaks  the
Editres  protocol.   In  addition, editres will help the user construct
resource specifications, allow the user to apply the  resource  to  the
application  and  view the results dynamically.  Once the user is happy
with a resource specification editres will append the  resource  string
to the user's X Resources file.
