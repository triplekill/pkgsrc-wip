It seems to run well but I have to do some bad hack in order that the perl
configure understands that we need an extra libs for oss. Maybe there is
another way smarter.

Patch the source to solve the /dev/dsp hardcoded sound using ${DEVOSSAUDIO}
or ${DEVOSSSOUND}. Maybe there is a proper way to do it using
ossaudio.buildlink3.mk
