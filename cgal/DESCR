The goal of the CGAL Open Source Project is to provide easy access to
efficient and reliable geometric algorithms in the form of a C++
library. CGAL is used in various areas needing geometric computation,
such as: computer graphics, scientific visualization, computer aided
design and modeling, geographic information systems, molecular
biology, medical imaging, robotics and motion planning, mesh
generation, numerical methods... More on the projects using CGAL web
