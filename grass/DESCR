Geographic Resources Analysis Support System, commonly referred to as
GRASS, is a Geographic Information System (GIS) used for data
management, image processing, graphics production, spatial modelling,
and visualization of many types of data.  GRASS contains over 350
programs and tools to

- render maps and images on monitors and paper,
- manipulate raster, vector, and sites data,
- process multi spectral image data, and
- create, manage, and store spatial data.

GRASS uses both an intuitive windows interface as well as command line
syntax for ease of operations.  GRASS is ideal for use in engineering
and land planning applications.
