# C News pkg issues

- 'make regression' fails on union mounts. Needs WRKOBJDIR set
- use USE_PKGINSTALL=YES for /var/news
- Sync patch list with dinoex.org
- provide sample cron entries for user 'news' in share/examples/c-news
- In NetBSD 3, postinstall removes the compatibility symlink /bin/rmail. 
  Have C News check for the new location /usr/libexec/rmail.
