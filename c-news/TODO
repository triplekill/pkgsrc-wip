# C News pkg issues

- use USE_PKGINSTALL=YES for /var/news
- sync patch list with dinoex.org
- provide sample cron entries for user 'news' in share/examples/c-news
- in NetBSD 3, postinstall removes the compatibility symlink /bin/rmail;
  have C News check for the new location /usr/libexec/rmail
- add DESTDIR support
- C News breaks on NetBSD-current, since 
  sizeof(time_t) == 8 != sizeof(long)
