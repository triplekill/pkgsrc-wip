# C News pkg issues

- use USE_PKGINSTALL=YES for /var/news
- sync patch list with dinoex.org
- provide sample cron entries for user 'news' in share/examples/c-news
- add DESTDIR support
- C News breaks on NetBSD-current, since 
  sizeof(time_t) == 8 != sizeof(long)
- wrt. the license, make sure that information about the sponsors
  gets installed (just install all the README files)
