# C News pkg issues

- use USE_PKGINSTALL=YES for /var/news
- sync patch list with dinoex.org
- provide sample cron entries for user 'news' in share/examples/c-news
- add DESTDIR support
- wrt. the license, make sure that information about the sponsors
  gets installed (just install all the README files)
- sizeof(time_t) == 8 != sizeof(long) -- make sure the parts that 
  tinker with time_t can cope with an int64_t (see libcnews/mkinperm.c)
- run the regression tests
  o getabsdate test fails
