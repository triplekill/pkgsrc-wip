     AIM Transport for Jabber, implemented with Python and Twisted


AIM portions written by Daniel Henninger
Jabber portions (bulk of) written by James Bunton
(ie: this is based on PyMSNt's code)

Current I have:
- ability to register with the transport
- ability to log in and out of aim via the transport
- ability to send and receive messages
  - no 'composing' events functionality yet
  - no 'xhtml' components yet (ie, non-straight text messages)
  (both of these need to be added to James's base code)
- ability to set away status
- ability to add to and remove from your server side buddy list
- it actually can use the spool that the c based aim transport uses
- support for roster import (adding AIM buddies to your jabber roster)
