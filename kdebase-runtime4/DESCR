The kdebase-runtime package is the second mandatory package (besides kdelibs)
for the K Desktop Environment. Here we have various applications and
infrastructure files and libraries. Here is an overview of the directories:

* drkonqi
    If ever an app crashes (heaven forbid!) then Dr.Konqi will be so kind
    and make a stack trace. This is a great help for the developers to fix
    the bug.
* kcontrol
    The KDE Control Center allows you to tweak the KDE settings.
* kdebugdialog
    Allows you to specify which debug messages you want to see.
* kdesktop
    You guessed it: the desktop above the panel.
* kdesu
    A graphical front end to "su".
* kfind
    File find utility (standalone and in Konqueror's file manager).
* khelpcenter
    Used to to read all great documentation about KDE, unix man pages,
    info pages etc.
* kioslave
    Infrastructure that helps make every application internet enabled
    e.g. to directly save a file to ftp://place.org/dir/file.txt
* kreadconfig
    A tool for shell scripts to get info from KDE's config files.
* kstart
    Launches applications with special window properties such as iconified,
    etc.
