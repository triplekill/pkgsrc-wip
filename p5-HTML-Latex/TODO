Hmmm... sourceforge version may be out-of-date
I see at  http://fresh.t-systems-sfr.com/unix/src/www/
a new version is available
 html2latex-1.1.tar.gz (25 Sep 2000, 48439 Bytes)

Also, I read
in Latex.pm, line 793
change the line from                              
     return "\\$command\{" . texify($html_element) . "\}\n";
to read:
     return "\\$command\{" . texify($html_element) . "\}";


DESCR says "downloading of URLs" but I didn't DEPEND on 
 LWP::Simple (called libwwwperl too)
 URI (libwww or Bundle::LWP)
because I don't need

Also Image::Magik perl module is used for convert images to PNG
which I don't use.

Should I depend on these?
