$NetBSD$

- JACK testing
- ALSA support for Linux builds
- Testing on platforms other than NetBSD. MilkyTracker is using a GNU
  configure script, but will happily work without things like 'ranlib'

tmpnam() will no longer be used in future releases, so there's no immediate
need to patch it in pkgsrc.
