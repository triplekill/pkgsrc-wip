Songwrite is a tablature (guitar partition) editor.

Songwrite is coded in Python and uses Tk (Tkinter); it relies on Timidity to
play midi and on GNU Lilypond for printing.

Songwrite was previously known as GTablature. Due to many incompatibilities
between Gnome 1 and Gnome 2, it is no longer a part of Gnome, and has been
renamed Songwrite. File compatibility is preserved between GTablature and
Songwrite.
