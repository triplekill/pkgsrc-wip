This is a port of the original rc shell from plan9 to Unix, based on
plan9ports[1], mk-with-libs.tgz[2] and wmii[3].

To use this shell the plan9ish way, a rcmain is needed which bootstraps a
shell environment. In contrast to the version of plan9ports[1] by Russ Cox,
this version checks for the $RCMAIN environment variable and uses that
file for bootstrapping. If that variable is not present, $PREFIX/lib/rcmain
is used as fallback. Like in plan9, you can supply
rc -m /path/to/alternate/rcmain file for interactive shells.

Many thanks go to Lucent, the Bell Labs which developed this fine shell
and to Russ Cox for his plan9ports. Since Lucent made plan9 open source,
we can get rid of Brian Rakitzis rc/unix implementation which behaves
not rc-standard-compliant.
