This defaults to /var/cron; maybe this should be noted in MESSAGE.
Could set some pkgsrc-wide VAR_DIR; then:
CPPFLAGS+=              -DCRONDIR='\"${VAR_DIR}/cron\"'

I did not add the rc.d/cron script to the PLIST. Since the install
is automated, then the PLIST addition should be automated.
It could be ${RCD_SCRIPTS_EXAMPLEDIR}/cron
and RCD_SCRIPTS_EXAMPLEDIR be part of system-wide PLIST_SUBST.

Need to have a MESSAGE on how to start cron at boot.
I didn't add this, because it should be consistent and
this should be automated too.

Please look at the extract step, this is so it is in own directory,
because the rc.d mechanism would install binary to rc.d/cron :(
Or maybe DECOMPRESS_CMD.shar could be defined instead.
