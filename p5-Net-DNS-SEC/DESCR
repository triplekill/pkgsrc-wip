This module implements DNS Resource Record types that are relevant
for DNSSEC operations. This package implements RFC4034
"Resource Records for the DNS Security Extensions" and RFC2931 "DNS
Request and Transaction Signatures ( SIG(0)s )"

RFC 3225 (Indicating Resolver Support of DNSSEC) support has been
is available Net::DNS.

The extensions provide the following additional features on top of
the Net::DNS package (http://www.net-dns.org/).

- DS, RRSIG, DNSKEY and NSEC records. These are all implemented as RR
  objects.  The cryptography has been implemented using
  Crypt::OpenSSL::DSA, Crypt::OpenSSL::RSA and related modules.

The reason for not making these RRs a part of the regular Net::DNS
distribution is that they rely on crypto modules that do not easily
port.
