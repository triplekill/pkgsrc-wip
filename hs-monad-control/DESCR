This package defines the type class MonadControlIO, a subset of
MonadIO into which generic control operations such as catch can be
lifted from IO. Instances are based on monad transformers in
MonadTransControl, which includes all standard monad transformers in
the transformers library except ContT. For convenience, it provides a
wrapped version of Control.Exception with types generalized from IO to
all monads in MonadControlIO.

Note that this package is a rewrite of Anders Kaseorg's monad-peel
library. The main difference is that this package provides CPS style
operators and exploits the RankNTypes language extension to simplify
most definitions.
