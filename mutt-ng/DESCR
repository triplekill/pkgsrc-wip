mutt-ng contains all the features that can also be found in mutt: we
constantly keep the mutt-ng source tree up-to-date with all the
changes that happen in the mutt source tree, but also add our own
bugfixes and features. A list of features unique to mutt-ng can be
found here:

    * Better view support for format=flowed attachments
    * Message IDs are configurable
    * User can set signoff_string just like in slrn
    * User can call up the "last folder" when saving attachments
    * IMAP reconnecting: when the connection to the IMAP server dies,
      mutt-ng attempts reconnecting
    * User can set the umask with which all the files shall be created
      (was hard-coded before, and caused huge problems for shared
      mailboxes to some people)
    * Support for NNTP, i.e. mutt-ng can be used as a newsreader
    * A sidebar similar to other (graphical) MUAs where you can
      directly jump to a certain mailbox
