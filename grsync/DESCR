Grsync is a GUI (Graphical User Interface) for rsync, the commandline
directory synchronization tool. It makes use of the GTK libraries and
is released under the GPL license, so it is opensource. It is in beta
stage and doesn't support all of rsync features, but can be effectively
used to synchronize local directories. For example some people use grsync
to synchronize their music collection with removable devices or to backup
personal files to a networked drive.
