Cawf is a nroff-like text formatter. Cawf provides a usable subset
of raw nroff capabilities and the styles of the man, me(7), and
ms(7) macro sets.  New macro files can be added.  And it has some
rudimentary output device support via a device configuration file
(and new devices can be added).

Written by Vic Abell, Cawf is a C version of awf, Henry Spencer's
Amazingly Workable (text) Formatter.

This package also includes a companion output filter, bsfilt(1),
which is a colcrt-like backspace filter.
