Is there a make variable expansion for removing like:
CAWFLIB=${CAWFLIB:S/${PREFIX}\///}
(for the PLIST)

The macros need a lot of help to be able to support
NetBSD's -mdoc and even -man. I started working on a 
new -mandoc but didn't include with this.

This uses its own getopt and regexp. Probably should
attempt to use the operating system's own.

man.mac needs to be a lot smarter, for example
.ds CH "Unix Programmer's Manual
should be set depending on section number,
like if 9 then: Kernel Manual
and Unix replaced with operating system name
