Is there a make variable expansion for removing like:
CAWFLIB=${CAWFLIB:S/${PREFIX}\///}
(for the PLIST)

The macros need a lot of help to be able to support
NetBSD's -mdoc and even -man. I started working on a 
new -mandoc but didn't include with this.

This uses its own getopt and regexp. Probably should
attempt to use the operating system's own.

man.mac needs to be a lot smarter, for example
.ds CH "Unix Programmer's Manual
should be set depending on section number,
like if 9 then: Kernel Manual
and Unix replaced with operating system name

This caused core dump:
.if '\\$1'0' ds CH "General Information
.if "\\$1"1" ds CH "Commands and Applications
.if '\\$1'2' ds CH "System Calls

This didn't work:
.if "\\$2"2" .ds CH "System Calls
It needs '\\$2'2'

need to make it so it doesn't append formfeed at end of man page
also don't append formfeed or date after each page

need to figure out:
\*[Lt] and for Gt too
I already have .Lt and .Gt defined but don't understand brackets

allow multiple macro file declarations as command-line arguments

if error message says $0 and is not cawf then also say cawf in (parenthesis)

cawf: (man1/zip.1, 125): unknown font C - \fCzip -r foo foo\fP
