AxKit is an XML Application Server for Apache. It provides on-the-fly
conversion from XML to any format, such as HTML, WAP or text using
either W3C standard techniques, or flexible custom code. AxKit also
uses a built-in Perl interpreter to provide some amazingly powerful
techniques for XML transformation.

The web site for AxKit is http://axkit.org/. There you will find lots
more documentation and example code. The complete source for axkit.org
is included in this distribution in the axkit.org directory.
