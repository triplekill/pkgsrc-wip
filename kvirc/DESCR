Fully scriptable graphical IRC client with plugin support
A highly configurable graphical IRC client with an MDI interface,
built-in scripting language, support for DCC, drag & drop, and much
more. KVIrc uses the Qt widget set, has support for KDE, has more
features than you can think of, can be extended using its own scripting
language, supports custom plugins and is nearly a desktop environment on
its own.
