  * files/cacerts stolen from a Sun JDK 1.6 installation -- is there
    a better source?

  * The JDK Makefiles use `gcc -w' to suppress all the static and
    inline warning messages from the build -- and there are lots!
    But `-w' is stripped by the pkgsrc wrappers for gcc.  Can we
    add this back in?  Is it worth it?
