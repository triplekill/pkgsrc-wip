  * Test other browsers (currently tested: firefox-2.0.0.2)

  * Fix up installation without the plugin

  * files/cacerts stolen from a Sun JDK 1.6 installation -- is there

  * The JDK Makefiles use `gcc -w' to suppress all the static and
    inline warning messages from the build -- and there are lots!

    add this back in?  Is it worth it?
