This is stand-alone package for libuuid, a part of e2fsprogs package.

The libuuid library is used to generate unique identifiers for objects that
may be accessible beyond the local system. The Linux implementation was
created to uniquely identify ext2 filesystems created by a machine. This
library generates UUIDs compatible with those created by the Open Software
Foundation (OSF) Distributed Computing Environment (DCE) utility uuidgen.

The UUIDs generated by this library can be reasonably expected to be unique
within a system, and unique across all systems. They could be used, for
instance, to generate unique HTTP cookies across multiple web servers
without communication between the servers, and without fear of a name clash.
