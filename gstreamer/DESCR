GStreamer is a framework for creating streaming media applications. The
fundamental design comes from the video pipeline at Oregon Graduate Institute,
as well as some ideas from DirectShow.

GStreamer's development framework makes it possible to write any type of
streaming multimedia application. The GStreamer framework is designed to make
it easy to write applications that handle either audio or video or both. The
pipeline design is made to have no extra overhead above what the applied
filters induce. This makes GStreamer a good framework for designing even
high-end audio applications which puts high demands on latency.
