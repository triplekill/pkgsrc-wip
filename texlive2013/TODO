TODO
- Interpreter path
  So many files are originally flagged in 
     Checking for non-existent script interpreters in texlive-20130530
  Now employing files/subst-shebang perl script to convert them
  (And there may be many redundency in this wip package).

- Does it really fit to pkgsrc ?
- How does user use tlmgr ?
- Conflicts to other texlive-* packages are not checked yet
- Configure
  Many hardcoded version name in libs
  May have '--with-system-cairo' type configure_arg not use cairo included,
  .. not checked in detail
- pkglint flags as
  WARN: PLIST:xx: The bin/ directory should not have subdirectories.
- LICENSE= not taken care yet (texlive-license or Public Domain ?)
- Following files are not checked yet:
  README.config
  -rw-r--r--   1 makoto  wheel    1196 Aug 30  2011 README.cross
  -rw-r--r--   1 makoto  wheel    5633 Nov 14  2012 README.distro
  -rw-r--r--   1 makoto  wheel    8229 Jan  4  2013 

- I was looking for pxdvi (and platex) in TeXLive, but it is not included yet
  (for this configuration of Makefile)
  See 
  http://tutimura.ath.cx/ptexlive/?tlptexlive%A5%EA%A5%DD%A5%B8%A5%C8%A5%EA
  Also to check
  http://www.tug.org/~preining/tlptexlive/

- (Being distributed) binary for TeXLive 2013 iso sizes 2.3GB. This package 
  produces some 500MB tgz. May be missing something.

- There is a Build script to do the same thing. This has to be checked.
