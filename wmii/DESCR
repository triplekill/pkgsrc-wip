Window manager improved 2 (wmii) is an improved, modularized and lightweight
X11 window manager which supports tabbed, tiled and conventional window
management. If it is build with cairo support, it also provides extended
rendering capabilities like alpha blending and UTF-8 capable anti-aliased
font rendering.

Wmii consists of components which are independent processes which communicate
via a socket-based virtual filesystem, which is oriented on the filesystem
paradigm of the plan9 operating system. The core distribution of wmii contains
the window manager itself, a pager (wmipager), a generic status bar (wmibar),
a shortcut handler (wmirat), and a generic ex-alike interaction menu (wmiinput)
beside several tiny utilities like wmir, wmiplumb, wmitw, and wmimulti.
