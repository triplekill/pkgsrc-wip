window manager improved 2 (wmii) is an improved, modularized and
lightweight X11 window manager which supports tabbed, tiled and
conventional window management through layouts.

wmii consists of components that are independent processes and
communicate via a socket-based virtual filesystem which is oriented on
the "everything is a file" paradigm of the plan9 operating system.

The core distribution of wmii contains the window manager itself, a
master file system routing utility (wmifs), a generic bar (wmibar), a
shortcut handler (wmikeys), and a generic interaction menu (wmimenu)
beside several tiny utilities like wmir, wmiplumb, and wmiwarp.
