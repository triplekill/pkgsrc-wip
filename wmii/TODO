Package compiles and installs cleanly.

* I have to substitute CONFPREFIX with ${LOCALBASE}/share/examples and
not ${PKG_SYSCONFDIR} since status.sh loses its permissions (755) when
getting copied over to ${LOCALBASE}/etc/wmii. Do not know if that is a
big problem, though.
* Through config.mk, one can choose between strncat/strncpy and strlcat/strlcpy
* The wmii-cairo package seems not to be right
