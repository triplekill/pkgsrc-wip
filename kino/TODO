Still frame export uses Imlib1 and maybe ImageMagick

MP3 export uses lame

Ogg Vorbis export uses oggenc (vorbis-tools)

MPEG-1, MPEG-2, and DivX require mjpegtools

clicking on Help->Contents:
/usr/share/kino/scripts/help.sh: line 1: gconftool: command not found
should be "gconftool-2"

should this be done?
lib/hotplug/kino/usb.usermap
should have an option or check if linux before installing hotplug stuff
use CONF_FILES for etc/hotplug/usb/kino-jogshuttle

require XFree86 4.x for building Kino, but if you have an older version, then
simply edit src/Makefile.am and remove "-lXv" from the line beginning with
"kino_LDADD=".

maybe have an option to use libdv versus ffmpeg
--with-avcodec       Use FFMPEG libavcodec for DV video decoding instead of libdv.
libdv is still required according to README

  --with-quicktime        Support Quicktime DV files using Quicktime4Linux or libquicktime.
  --with-x                use the X Window System
  --with-hotplug-script-dir=PATH Where to install hotplug scripts PREFIX/etc/hotplug/usb
  --with-hotplug-usermap-dir=PATH Where to install hotplug usermaps PREFIX/lib/hotplug/kino

was using:

#LDFLAGS+=              ${COMPILER_RPATH_FLAG}${BUILDLINK_LIBDIRS.XFree86-libs}
# XXX how does the RPATHs for gcc3 not get chopped out by buildlink3?
# the following one seemed to work
#BUILDLINK_PASSTHRU_RPATHDIRS+= ${X11BASE}/lib
# the following is not set yet
#BUILDLINK_PASSTHRU_RPATHDIRS+= ${BUILDLINK_LIBDIRS.XFree86-libs}
