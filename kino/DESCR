Kino is a non-linear digital video (DV) editor. It can be used to record,
create, edit, and play movies recorded with DV camcorders.  It features
integration with IEEE 1394 for capture, VTR control, and recording back
to the camera. It captures video to disk in AVI format in both type-1
DV and type-2 DV (separate audio stream) encodings.

You can load multiple video clips into a playlist, cut and paste portions
of video/audio, and save it to a playlist.  This program uses many
keyboard commands for fast navigating and editing inside the movie.
Kino can load playlists and save the composite playlist as a new DV
AVI file.  Kino can save a single frame of video (a still) in numerous
file formats. Currently only support OSS audio.
