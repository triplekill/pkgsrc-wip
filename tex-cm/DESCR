Knuth's final iteration of his re-interpretation of a c.19
Modern-style font from Monotype. The family is comprehensive,
offering both sans and roman styles, and a monospaced font,
together with mathematics fonts closely integrated with the
mathematical facilities of TeX itself. The base fonts are
distributed as MetaFont source, but autotraced PostScript Type
1 versions are available (see the Bluesky/Y&Y and BaKoMa
versions). The Computer Modern fonts have inspired many later
families, notably the European Computer Modern and the Latin
Modern families.
