Quilt is a tool to manage large sets of patches by keeping track
of the changes each patch makes. Patches can be applied, un-applied,
refreshed, etc. The key philosophical concept is that your primary
output is patches.

Quilt manages a stack of patches. Patches are applied incrementally
on top of the base tree plus all preceding patches. They can be
pushed on top of the stack and popped off the stack Commands are
available for querying the contents of the series file, the contents
of the stack and the patches that are not applied at a particular
moment.  By default, most commands apply to the topmost patch on
the stack.
