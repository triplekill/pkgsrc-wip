- The package seems to work with pth only.  As seen in the configure script,
  it does not check for anything else, although it might work with a native
  implementation.  Somebody (jabberd developers?) should try and hack the
  configure script to detect the right threading implementation ;)

- There is no need for files/jabber.sh to have execute permissions.  When
  importing this package in pkgsrc, fix it.
