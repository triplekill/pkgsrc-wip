m4 files needed by meta-pkgs/gnome-devel  ... why??

make a mk/libintl.mk file?
gettext-runtime provides libintl.so on NetBSD even if NetBSD has native

this package is big ... probably should split libgnuintl (libintl) out?

under NetBSD this conflicts with gettext-runtime -- it should not.
It should not use libintl again (instead of libgnuintl).

old gettext needed groff to build
