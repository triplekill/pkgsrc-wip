GnuCash is designed to be easy to use, yet powerful and flexible.
It allows you to track bank accounts, stocks, income and expenses.
As quick and intuitive to use as a checkbook register, it is based
on professional accounting principles to ensure balanced books and
accurate reports. It is extensible in guile (an embedded scheme
interpreter).
