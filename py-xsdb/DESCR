The xsdb package provides fundamental concurrent database functionality with
concurrency control and recovery. Fundamental characteristics include:

* Extreme portability and ease of installation and use.
* A simple semantics of objects with associated descriptions
  compatible with the relational model, object modelling methods, and other
  data organizations such as OLAP.
* Multiple access paths and indices.
* Timestamp based concurrency control for safe concurrent database access.
* Commit/Rollback and recovery support.
* A variety of underlying storage implementations with configurable
  features and performance characteristics.
* No intrinsic database size limitations.

General Technical Notes: The xsdb package is implemented in Python, and the
server mode requires stackless python. An xsdb database (not in server mode)
will run using standard C Python or Java Python (Jython), and in particular
the client for an xsdb database may be a java program. It is possible to
create clients in other programming platforms for interacting with xsdb
(although none exist at this writing). The package will run on all hardware
and operating system platforms that support Python and/or java (including MS
Windows variants, Mac OS, Linux, most Unices, and many others).
