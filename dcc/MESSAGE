If your site handles more than 100,000 messages per day, to decrease the
load on the public DCC servers and increase the responsiveness of your
DCC clients, you should set up your own, local DCC server connected to
the global network of DCC servers.

If you run the DCC server, cron-dccd should be run at least daily from the
crontab to clean old checksums from the DB.

The free DCC source is available only for non-commercial and some other
uses.  It is not available to organizations that sell anti-spam appliances
or provide managed email services as opposed to common Internet service.
