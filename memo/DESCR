Memo is a note-taking and to-do software written in C. Memo runs on command
line.

With Memo, it's possible to concentrate on the tasks in your to-do list
instead of spending time managing those tasks. After a while taking notes
and keeping a to-do list is part of your daily life instead of some nasty
thing you must remember to do.

Memo is Free Software under the GPL licence and is maintained by Niko
