Ion2 is a tiling tabbed window manager designed with keyboard users in mind. 

# Fully documented configuration and scripting interface on top of the
lightweight Lua (http://www.lua.org/) extension language.
# Modular design. The main binary implements only basic window manager
functionality. Actual window management policies are implemented by 
dynamically loaded workspace and other modules.
# The query module implements a line editor similar to mini buffers in
many text editors. It is used to implement many different queries with
tab-completion support: show manual page, run program, open SSH session,
view file, goto named client window or workspace, etc.
# To run those few particularly badly behaving programs, Ion also 
supports conventional workspaces of the PWM flavour through the floatws
module. This module is also used to implement PWM2 on top of the Ion
core library.
# Other modules include the drawing engine, dock module for window maker
dockapp support, menu module and, of course, the tiled workspaces module.
# Full screen client window are seen as workspaces on their own. It is
possible to switch to a normal workspace while keeping several client
windows in full screen state and also switch clients that do not
themselves support full screen mode to this state.
