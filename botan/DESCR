Botan (formerly OpenCL) aims to be a portable, easy to use, and efficient
C++ crypto library. It currently supports the following algorithms and primes:

    * Public key encryption algorithms RSA, ElGamal, DLIES (OAEP, PKCS #1 v1.5)
    * Public key signature algorithms RSA, DSA, ECDSA, Nyberg-Rueppel,
      Rabin-Williams (PSS, PKCS #1 v1.5, X9.31)
    * Key agreement techniques Diffie-Hellman and ECKAEG
    * Block cipher modes ECB, CBC, CBC/CTS, CFB, OFB, CTR and  EAX
    * AES (Rijndael) and AES candidates Serpent, Twofish, MARS, CAST-256, RC6
    * DES, and variants 3DES and DESX
    * Stream ciphers ARC4, Salsa20, Turing, and WiderWake4+1
    * National/telecom block ciphers SEED, KASUMI, MISTY1, GOST 28147, Skipjack
    * Other block ciphers including Blowfish, CAST-128, IDEA, Noekeon, TEA,
      XTEA, RC2, RC5, SAFER-SK, and Square
    * Block cipher constructions Luby-Rackoff and Lion
    * Authentication codes HMAC, CMAC (aka OMAC1), CBC-MAC, ANSI X9.19 DES-MAC,
    * Hash functions SHA-1, SHA-224, SHA-256, SHA-384, SHA-512, Whirlpool, Tiger
      RIPEMD-160, RIPEMD-128, HAS-160, GOST 34.11, MD2, MD4, MD5, FORK-256
    * Checksums Adler32, CRC24, CRC32
    * X.509 certificates (+ generating new self-signed and CA certs), X.509 CRLs
    * PKCS #10 certificate requests
    * Card Verifiable Certificates (used in ePassports)
    * PBKDFs: PBKDF1 from PKCS #5 v1.5, PBKDF2 from PKCS #5 v2.0 OpenPGP S2K
    * KDF1 and KDF2 from IEEE 1363
    * PRFs from ANSI X9.42, SSL v3.0, TLS v1.0
