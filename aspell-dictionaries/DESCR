GNU Aspell is a Free and Open Source spell checker designed to eventually
replace Ispell.

This package does not contain anything by itself - it is a "meta-package" that
depends on other aspell packages. Its sole purpose is to require dependencies so
users can install this package only and have all the aspell stuff (or what is
set in PKG_OPTIONS.aspell-dictionaries) pulled in by the package dependency
mechanism.
