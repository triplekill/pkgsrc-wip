libical's pkg-config pc is probably wrong since its headers
include its owner headers with <foo> instead of "foo" and don't have
the path it is in.

This happens repeatedly:

(osmo:26090): GLib-GObject-WARNING **: invalid uninstantiatable type `(null)' in cast to `GtkLabel'

(osmo:26090): Gtk-CRITICAL **: IA__gtk_label_set_markup: assertion `GTK_IS_LABEL (label)' failed

seen when I closed window but still running in background (in system tray)

maybe see debian package for the patches
