- Thread bug fixed for curses version only, GTK still buggy.
- Does not support PlugIns under NetBSD yet. I assume this is
because ettercap doesn't see that we don't need a library for dlopen()
under NetBSD.
- The following should not be set by a package: Instead, depend on
appropriate versions, or for ncurses, set USE_NCURSES to the missing
function/symbol in NetBSD curses.
USE_BUILTIN.libpcap=    no
USE_BUILTIN.ncurses=    no
USE_BUILTIN.openssl=    no
