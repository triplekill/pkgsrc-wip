mim is a program that allows a user to watch MPEG-I multicast audio and 
video streams such as those sourced by Cisco System's IP/TV, fvc.com's 
I-Caster, and live.com's liveCaster. mim requires the mtvp program from 
MPEGTV (http://www.mpegtv.com). mtvp is used to decode the MPEG-1 audio
and video streams.
