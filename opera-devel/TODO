- 5 warnings from pkglint, probably the best we can get...
- support for FreeBSD. Is patch-aa necessary/correct?
- support for Linux?
- what about OpenBSD?
- testing on Solaris/sparc, especially the Adobe Acrobat integration.
  PLIST.SunOS should be correct

- the spell checker does not work without libaspell.so.15. Platforms using
  the Linux packages would need a working RPM for aspell.
  On FreeBSD and Solaris textproc/aspell might do the trick
