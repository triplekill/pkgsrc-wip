You will need to make joomla accessible through your HTTP server.
If you are running Apache and ap-php, then you can add the following line
to httpd.conf:

        Include ${JOOMLA_CONFFILE}

to make joomla accessible through:

	http://www.domain.com/joomla/

Your Apache server must also be configured to support PHP, and PHP
must be configured to support zlib and MySQL by including these two
lines in php.ini:

extension=zlib.so
extension=mysql.so
