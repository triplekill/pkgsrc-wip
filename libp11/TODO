$NetBSD$
Doesn't build on NetBSD-3.0_BETA with the following error:

  configure: error: Package requirements (openssl) were not met.
  Consider adjusting the PKG_CONFIG_PATH environment variable if you
  installed software in a non-standard prefix.

  Alternatively you may set the OPENSSL_CFLAGS and OPENSSL_LIBS
  environment variables to avoid the need to call pkg-config.
