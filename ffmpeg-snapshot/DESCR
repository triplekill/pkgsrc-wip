FFmpeg is a complete solution to record, convert and stream audio and video.
It includes libavcodec, the leading audio/video codec library. FFmpeg is
developed under Linux, but it can compiled under most operating systems,
including Windows.

The project is made of several components:

  * ffmpeg is a command line tool to convert one video file format to
    another. It also supports grabbing and encoding in real time from a TV
    card.
  * ffserver is an HTTP (RTSP is being developped) multimedia streaming
    server for live broadcasts. Time shifting of live broadcast is also
    supported.
  * ffplay is a simple media player based on SDL and on the FFmpeg libraries.
  * libavcodec is a library containing all the FFmpeg audio/video encoders
    and decoders. Most codecs were developped from scratch to ensure best
    performances and high code reusability.
  * libavformat is a library containing parsers and generators for all common
    audio/video formats.

This package fetches nightly builds from mplayer's site, no checksums made.
