CVSToys is a collection of companion tools for the Concurrent Versions
System, better known as CVS. The biggest best and only toy we've got is
Fresh CVS, a commit monitoring daemon which can keep a mirror of the
repository or checked-out working copy up to date, and send out
notifications by e-mail, on the web as HTML or RSS, or to a chat service
such as IRC.
