DrWright is a program that reminds you to take regular breaks from your
computer.  Its main focus is being usable and to simply work.

DrWright monitors keyboard and mouse activity and displays a small meter
in the notification area on your panel.  When it starts blinking, you know
it's time to take a break.  If you don't, it will lock your screen to
force a break.
