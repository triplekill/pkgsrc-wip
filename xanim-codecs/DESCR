As of revision 2.80, XAnim will scan the directory "/usr/local/xanim/mods"
(or directories listed in the XANIM_MOD_DIR env variable if set) for
xanim specific dynamically loadable libraries(dll's).  It will
automatically load these at start up. This way new video codecs for
AVI and Quicktime can be added without having to recompile XAnim.
