rc.subr usage WARNING refers to manual page
/etc/rc.d/sshd: WARNING: $sshd is not set properly - see rc.conf(5)

and example rc.conf should mentions manual page but it is not installed

need to install manual pages: rc.conf and rc.subr, but NetBSD
versions are too NetBSD specific

should figure out paths to commands before installing
in rc.subr

why not always use "echo"?

maybe backup_file should be in another shell script?
does FreeBSD rcNG have that?

make sure this works same as FreeBSD would expect

get rid of that OPSYS check in rc.subr

get rid of many _RCCMD_ parts by using @WHATEVER@ directly in code ??

on my own Linux, depend on my packages for mount, logger, kill, bash, etc...

improve DESCRiption
