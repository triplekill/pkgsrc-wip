Sphinx is a full-text search engine, distributed under GPL version 2.
Commercial license is also available for embedded use.

Generally, it's a standalone search engine, meant to provide fast,
size-efficient and relevant fulltext search functions to other
applications. Sphinx was specially designed to integrate well with
SQL databases and scripting languages. Currently built-in data sources
support fetching data either via direct connection to MySQL or
PostgreSQL, or using XML pipe mechanism (a pipe to indexer in special
XML-based format which Sphinx recognizes).

As for the name, Sphinx is an acronym which is officially decoded as
SQL Phrase Index. Yes, I know about CMU's Sphinx project.
