-  is mixed case zyGrib name ok?

-  this archive includes libz, libbz2 and libsha which are all built
   statically and linked to the binary. We should really dispense with
   those and use the shared library versions already in the OS where
   possible

-  it is possible to load some finer detail coastlines, just by extracting
   the relevant files to the maps/gshhs directory. should this be an option
   or another package? (intermediate->6Mb, high->20Mb, full->80Mb)
