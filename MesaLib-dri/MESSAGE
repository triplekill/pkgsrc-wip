$NetBSD:$

To use this package as a replacement for graphics/MesaLib, simply copy
the replacement buildlink3.mk file in this directory to
${PKGSRCDIR}/graphics/MesaLib/buildlink3.mk.  I hope to soon have the rest
of the MesaLib packages available; in the meantime, you can try changing
the version number of the Mesa packages in pkgsrc-wip to 7.0.  If you have
trouble, please email me at blair.sadewitz@gmail.com and I will 
endeavor to help you.
