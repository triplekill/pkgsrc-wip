--Libtoolize driver build?  Libtoolize mklib instead?
--Integrate Interix/LP64/etc patches from graphics/MesaLib(?)
--Seperate out libGL, dri drivers, and perhaps libGLw into their own packages.
--solidify changes and eliminate subst.mk.
--update other packages in pkgsrc-wip for 7.0
--Maintain distribution patchset, ultimately intended for our mirror sites,
to track changes on the GIT 7.0 branch between releases.  This will simplify
the patches in MesaLib/patches quite a bit.
