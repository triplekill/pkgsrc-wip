The OGP Surveying and Positioning Committee, through its geodesy
sub-committee, maintains and publishes a dataset of parameters for
coordinate reference system and coordinate transformation description.
The EPSG Geodetic Parameter Dataset has been included as reference
data in UKOOA and SEG positioning data exchange formats, the GeoTIFF
interchange format for georeferenced raster imagery, the IHS Energy
Iris21, PPDM and POSC Epicentre data models.  The dataset is
distributed in an MS Access relational database and SQL script files.

This current release (Version 6.11) of the EPSG Geodetic Parameter
Dataset comprises of data updates to the v6.10 release of April 2006.
It also replaces interim releases v6.10.1 of May 2006 and v6.10.2 of
June 2006 which included updates to the SQL scripts accompanying the
v6.10 release.  The EPSG Geodetic Parameter Dataset, or EPSG dataset,
is maintained by the Geodesy Subcommittee of the Surveying and
Positioning Committee of the International Association of Oil and Gas
Producers (OGP).

This package includes the PostgreSQL and mySQL scripts for creating
the EPSG database.
