Duff is a Unix command-line utility for quickly finding duplicates
in a given set of files.

How does it work:
 - Only compare files if they're of equal size.
 - Compare a few bytes before checksumming large files.
 - Compare checksums before actual contents.
 - Don't compare actual contents unless explicitly asked.
