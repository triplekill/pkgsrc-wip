Mostly the same as pkgtools/pbulk.

Because author of pbulk doesn't give me a clever explanation why he
declines a number of my proposals for pbulk I've made a decision to
fork it :-(. No, I have no plan to heavily develop it - I dislike its
overbloated design. I just need it to make bulk builds in parallel.
And I disagree with author's vision how MY bulk builds should be done.

Fixed PRs:
  pkg/36985 pbulk doesn't like .tbz (bzip2) extension
            for binary pkgsrc packages
  pkg/37002 pkgtools/pbulk  libexec/scan utility fails on Linux
            (already fixed differently in pkgtools/pbulk?)
  pkg/37100 pkgtools/pbulk: scan stage fails on Linux
            (not really fixed, but not critical anymore)
  pkg/37139 pkgtools/pbulk report subcomponent should quote
            recipient's email addres
  pkg/37539 more modules for pkgtools/pbulk
  pkg/37700 pbulk's resolve stage stops the bulk build
