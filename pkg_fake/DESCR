pkg_fake allows you to create fake packages into the pkgsrc database.

pkg_fake also permits you to create fake alternatives on already existing
packages. This is so useful for the 'python' package for example.

By this way you'll be able to deceive pkgsrc and skip some dependencies or
just to solve problems on packages that can't be installed fine because
portability problems in the target package, etc.
