-- Use options framework so those who don't want to suffer dependency hell
might opt-out.
-- The FUSE plugin does not build on NetBSD because we're missing 
fuse_lowlevel.h.  I'm not sure whether or not this will [ever] be supported,
so we'll leave it alone for now.  The final package should at least build
it on platforms where filesystems/fuse is supported.
-- Does it even work?  Haven't gotten a change to try it yet because I 
accidentally built my X server without the composite extension. :(
