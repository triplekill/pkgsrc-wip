This is a package for the development branch of Scribus:
"This release is purely a bug fix release to the recently released 1.3.3.
The rationale is that there will be substantial core code changes in the
next 1.3.4 and 1.3.5 releases, so the team has branched 1.3.3 to provide
a stable usable development version."

I don't think that it should replace existing print/scribus package, because
the official stable release is 1.2.5 (print/scribus is 1.2.4.1, though).

I think it's ready to use, please tell me if you're experiencng any problems.
