- Cleanup the Makefile.

- Depend on gnome1-dirs and change the PLIST to behave properly.

- Test the package... I don't have the time to build all GNOME1 stuff now.

- Review dependancies, just to be sure they are all ok WRT versions.

- Check if it works fine without USE_GNU_GETTEXT.

- Try to replace USE_X11BASE with USE_X11, and see if the program behaves
  properly (without xpkgwedge)... I don't know if this is possible, as
  almost all other GNOME1 stuff is installed under X11BASE.
