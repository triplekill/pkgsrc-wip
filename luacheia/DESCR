Features of LuaCheia are:

 * Portable and ported to Apple OS X, POSIX/X Window System and Microsoft
   Windows platforms. Use GNU autoconf to support automatic building on a wide
   variety of systems.
 * Standard binary distributions for the supported platforms. One-stop
   shopping for users interested in experimenting with Lua, or using it for
   general-purpose scripting.
 * Modularity. Only a very small core is mandatory, which is essentially the
   stock official Lua 5 distribution with bug patches. LuaCheia is implemented
   as a wrapper and bootscript around the normal stand-alone Lua executable.
   The wrapper can easily be pointed at a modified Lua interpreter if you like
   to experiment with the core itself.
 * Incorporate many different useful libraries.
 * Libraries are loaded dynamically so the core stays small.
 * Ample, standardized documentation (partly TODO).
