Some time ago Inaki G. Etxebarria, the original author of this
program, bought a TV card for his computer.  In his Linux box there
were only a few TV viewing programs, and none of them for Gnome.
So he built a TV viewer following V4L2 spec (at that time not part
of stable kernels), trying to make it as complete as possible. This
is the latest version of that software.

Zapping requires an analog TV card, with a driver supporting the
- V4L or V4L2 API on Linux, or the
- BKTR API on FreeBSD, or the
- XVideo API.
