FriCAS is a fork of Axiom.

The basic goal of FriCAS is create a free advanced world-class CAS.
FriCAS builds on Axiom codebase. Currently (September 2007) FriCAS
algebra library is largest and most advanced free general purpose
computer algebra system -- this gives a good foundation to build
on.  Additionaly, FriCAS algebra library is written in a high
level strongly typed langage (Spad), which allows natural expression
of mathematical algorithms.  This makes FriCAS easier to understand
and extend.

FriCAS uses lightweight developement methodology.  Compared to Axiom
FriCAS is significantly restructured -- it is more portable and fixed
several defects.  FriCAS removed rather large unused parts (without
removing functionality).  It is expected that FriCAS will be much
easier to maintain than original Axiom.
