The `same' utility looks for identical files and links them together
using either hard links or symbolic links, saving disk space.

Changes to the original version:
* the file ownership and permissions are checked (The original version
  checked only the file size)
* the messages in the "dry-run" mode were suggesting
  that anything on the disk would be modified. They
  have been made clear.
