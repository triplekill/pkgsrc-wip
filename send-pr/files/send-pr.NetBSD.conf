# By default send-pr connects directly to the database.  However, it can be
# configured to use an existing template file by setting the TEMPLATE variable
# below to point to a PR template generated from "send-pr -P".
#TEMPLATE=""

# send-pr can use mail to submit PRs, instead of connecting to the database
# directly.  MAILPROG needs to point to a compatible mailer (sendmail will
# work).  If MAILPROG needs to have the address that the mail is being sent to
# specified on the command line, it should be specified here as well (for
# example, the command MAILPROG="mail bugs@foo.bar.com" should work).  If
# sendmail is used, this should be set to MAILPROG="/usr/lib/sendmail -oi -t"
#MAILPROG=""

# The address that PRs are sent to.  Normally this can be left as "bugs";
# however, if using mail to submit PRs, this should be set to the address where
# PRs should be sent.
