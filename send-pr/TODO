maybe remove send-pr from database/gnats and depend on this instead
(and get rid of any CONFLICTs)
but then share/gnats/dist may need to be chowned the gnats user ??

check to make sure defaults are appropriate even on NetBSD
install-sid should be installed to ${PREFIX}/sbin

have empty GNATS_ADDR
empty DEFAULT_RELEASE
empty GNATS_SITE

should this predefine GNATS_ROOT??

maybe provide a ${GNATS_ROOT}/gnats-adm/config file ??

allow somethings to be set with variables
and don't edit file after installation with install-sid
(and make install-sid modify config file instead)
maybe add option for PKG_SYSCONFDIR/send-pr.conf
(be sure to submit patches back to real gnats developers.)

should MESSAGE include:
Any users who wish to use the Emacs version of `send-pr' must place
    the following line in their ".emacs" files:

        (autoload 'send-pr "send-pr" "Submit a Problem Report." t)

should this use RMDIR for the gnats directory like it does for emacs?
(because my mit-krb5 package provides a mit gnats categories file,
maybe it shouldn't?)
