The AccountManager offers several features for managing user accounts:

    * allow users to register new accounts
    * login via an HTML form instead of using HTTP authentication
    * allow existing users to change their passwords or delete their accounts

These features are new in the plugin for Trac 0.10.

    * send a new password to users who've forgotten their password
    * administration of user accounts
