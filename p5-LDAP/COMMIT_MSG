    ------
    Until the source catches up to the current Perl API, we need PERL_POLLUTE
    to look like an older perl.
    ------
(upstream)
 -- Update 1.2.2 (imported to pkgsrc in 1999) to 1.4.1
--------------------------------------------------
2000-09-19  Leif Hedstrom  <leif@perldap.org>

	the entry again.

2000-09-19  Leif Hedstrom  <leif@perldap.org>

	* Entry.pm (DESTROY): Bug fix from daniel.hams@db.com (Daniel
	Hams) to avoid warnings from Apache and mod_perl.

2000-09-13  Leif Hedstrom  <leif@perldap.org>

	* Utils.pm (askPassword): Oops, stupid typo here, should be
	"unless $prompt" of course...

2000-09-13  Leif Hedstrom  <leif@perldap.org>

	not working at all... :)

1999-08-16  Kevin McCarthy  <kmccarth@perldap.org> and Leif Hedstrom

	* API.xs: Cleaned most all the memory allocation changes, we are
	changing it to use the LDAP_OPT_MEMALLOC_FN_PTRS option in the
	C-SDK instead (much cleaner!).

	handlers. This is called when the API module is loaded.

	Perl'ified version, change a number of free()'s to use Safefree.

1999-08-15  Leif Hedstrom  <leif@netscape.com>

	* Entry.pm (setValues): Implemented bug fix for bug id 7131, where

1999-08-14  Kevin McCarthy  <kmccarth@perldap.org>

	operations. Basically, we'll try to do whatever seems to be the
	smallest amount of work for the LDAP server now.

1999-08-13  Leif Hedstrom  <leif@netscape.com>

	* Makefile.PL: Cleaned up code, and added support for linking in

	* Entry.pm (setValues): Renamed, used to be setValue(), which is
	now an alias to setValues().
	(getValues): New method, to get the array of values.
	(STORE): Fixed tests around DN handling, making sure it's not
	treated as an array. I also optimized a couple of tests, since we
	now filter out "DN" earlier in the funtion(s).

	(attrClean): Ditto.
	(unRemove): Ditto.
	(removeValue): Ditto.
	(addValue): Ditto.

1999-08-06  Leif Hedstrom  <leif@netscape.com> and Kevin McCarthy

	* API.xs: Added some more tests around free() statements. These
	are most likely never triggered, but better safe than sorrow (and
	the overhead of testing this is insignificant).

	* Conn.pm (browse): Added this function, to make it easy to browse
	an entry.
	(compare): Compare an attribute value against a DN/entry, without
	having to do the search.

	* Entry.pm (removeValue): Fixed loop bug.
	(addValue): Ditto.
	(hasValue): Ditto.

	* Entry.pm (size): Optimzied for performance.

1999-07-25  Kevin McCarthy  <kmccarth@perldap.org>

        * API.xs: Fixed memory allocation problems in parsing and
        generating the LDAPMods structure.

1999-06-22  Leif Hedstrom  <leif@netscape.com>

        * Conn.pm (add): Fixed bug 3342, thanks to Kevin McCarthy for

	(search): Avoid warnings of uninitialized variables.
	(searchURL): Ditto.
	(modifyRDN): Bugfix, we did not update the appropriate DN in the
	self object (very minor...).

	* Entry.pm: Cleanup in use statements, and "use strict".
	(BEGIN): Added this initializer, to use the new LDIF module.
	(STORE): Fixed bug where we would not ignore the internal instance
	variables properly.

	enforces the VERSION control feature.
