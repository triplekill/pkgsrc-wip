MCatS is a Modular Catalog System.
The basic idea is to have several modules (shared libraries) that are dynamicly loaded on demand.
Lets say you want to scan a CD-ROM media and store it in a database, you just specify that you want to read from cd and output to database.
By it's flexibility it makes it very easy to convert between different formats, like between "WhereIsIt?" and csv format.

This package includes support for:
cdinput
stdout
wii

Additional iodbc support can be obtained by installing mcats-iodbc package.
