The current stable release is v4.0.3, from 2013/11/24, (what changed?):

Check your language binding and see whether it already
supports zeroMQ v4.0. We recommend this release to anyone
developing new applications with zeroMQ who needs strong
encryption. The encryption mechanisms in zeroMQ v4.0 are however
considered experimental. Release 4.0.3 is network-compatible
with stable releases 3.2 and 2.2.
