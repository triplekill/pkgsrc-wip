coreutils (core GNU utilities)

These are the GNU core utilities, the basic command line programs
such as 'mkdir', 'ls', and 'rm' that are needed for the system to
run.  This package is the union of the GNU fileutils, sh-utils, and
textutils packages.  Most of these programs have significant
advantages over their Unix counterparts, such as greater speed,
additional options, and fewer arbitrary limits.
