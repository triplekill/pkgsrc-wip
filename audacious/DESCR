Audacious is an open source audio player. A descendant of XMMS, Audacious plays
your music how you want it, without stealing away your computer resources from
other tasks. Drag and drop folders and individual song files, search for artists
and albums in your entire music library, or create and edit your own custom
playlists. Listen to CD or stream music from the Internet. Tweak the sound with
the graphical equalizer or experiment with LADSPA effects. Enjoy the modern GTK-
themed interface or change things up with Winamp classic skins. Use the plugins
included with Audacious to fetch lyrics for your music, to set an alarm in the
morning, and more.

Audacious runs on Linux, on BSD derivatives, and on Microsoft Windows.
