GNUnet is a framework for secure peer-to-peer networking
that does not use any centralized or otherwise trusted
services. A first service implemented on top of the
networking layer allows anonymous censorship-resistant
file-sharing. GNUnet uses a simple, excess-based economic
model to allocate resources. Peers in GNUnet monitor each
others behavior with respect to resource usage; peers that
contribute to the network are rewarded with better service.

GNUnet is part of the GNU project. Our official GNU website
