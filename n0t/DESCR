n0t should be run on network routers/servers. It is useful to get info
about machines that are connected to you. You can use n0t to:
  - watch traffic on your server (+ verbose output & packet dump),
  - identify remote OS (also ACK + ...),
  - sniff packets in your network,
  - detect SYN, XMAS, NULL scan (including NMap),
  - detect NAT (Network Address Translation),
  - print distance to the remote machine (hops),
  - much more.
