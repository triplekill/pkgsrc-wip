This pkg builds the base, C compiler, from the 
GNU Compiler Collection (GCC) version 3.4. It is
one of a set of gcc3-*-devel pkgs, and is required
by all others.

Version 3.4 of gcc is the developmental release. This
package builds the compiler from the ${SNAPDATE}
snaphot.

This set of packages is based on the lang/gcc3-* set
of packages.
