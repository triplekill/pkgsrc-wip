SCIM is a spreadsheet program that is based on SC.

A spreadsheet is an interactive computer application program for
organization and analysis of data in tabular form. Spreadsheets
are developed as computerized simulations of paper accounting
worksheets. The program operates on data represented as cells of
an array, organized in rows and columns. Each cell of the array is
a model-view-controller element that can containn either numeric or
text data, or the results of formulas that automatically calculate
and display a value based on the contents of other cells.
