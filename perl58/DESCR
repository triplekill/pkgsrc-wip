Perl is a high-level programming language with an eclectic heritage
written by Larry Wall and a cast of thousands.  It derives from the
ubiquitous C programming language and to a lesser extent from sed, awk,
the Unix shell, and at least a dozen other tools and languages.  Perl's
process, file, and text manipulation facilities make it particularly
well-suited for tasks involving quick prototyping, system utilities,
software tools, system management tasks, database access, graphical
programming, networking, and world wide web programming.  These strengths
make it especially popular with system administrators and CGI script
authors, but mathematicians, geneticists, journalists, and even managers
also use Perl.  Maybe you should, too.
