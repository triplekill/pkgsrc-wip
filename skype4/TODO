1) Make this stop crashing a few seconds after execution;
   This is probably due to incomplete emulation of the Linux tgkill(2) syscall.
   syscalls leading up to crash:
  6398  16934 skype    CALL  rt_sigaction(SIGABRT,0xf5dfe8a8,0,8)
  6398  16934 skype    RET   rt_sigaction 0
  6398  16934 skype    CALL  rt_sigprocmask(1,0xf5dfe8d8,0,8)
  6398  16934 skype    RET   rt_sigprocmask 0
  6398  16934 skype    CALL  tgkill(0x18fe,0x4226,6)
  6398  16934 skype    RET   tgkill 0
  6398  16934 skype    PSIG  SIGABRT SIG_DFL: code=SI_LWP sent by pid=6398, uid=1000)

2) Add PulseAudio as a PKG_OPTION, defaulting to enabled;
3) Figure out where skype.conf in the ${DISTFILE} goes during install;
