This package does not build on NetBSD due to portability issues with 
va_copy. Upstream developer said:

  This means that the compiler claims to be compliant to an ANSI or ISO 
  standard before C99 but defines va_copy anyway. If the former is true, 
  va_copy is no reserved identifier and must not be defined by the 
  compiler. At least this is my interpretation of the standard is how 
  other compilers implement it. Maybe someone active in -BSD development 
  can comment on it.

See discussion in pkgsrc-wip-discuss beginning 7/jul/2008.
