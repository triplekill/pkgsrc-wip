This package builds and installs fine.

Things which still need to be done:
1.) Create a user "radicale" under which to run the server.
2.) Write a "rc.d" script:
    - It will have to use "su" to start the daemon as the desired user.
    - As the pid file will be created by the unpriviliged user account
      it needs to be created before the "su" using "root" privileges.
3.) The example/default config file might need some tweaking.
