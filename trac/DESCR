Trac is a minimalistic web-based software project management and bug/issue
tracking system.  It provides an interface to the Subversion revision control
systems, an integrated wiki, flexible issue tracking and convenient report
facilities.

This package is very similar to www/ja-trac.  (Ideally www/trac and
www/ja-trac would be more similar and this package no longer needed.)
