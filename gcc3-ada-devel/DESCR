This pkg builds the GNU Compiler Collection (GCC) version 3.4 Ada compiler.
This is a devepmental release. 

The pkg works with the other pkgs in the gcc3-*-devel set of packages to
support a number of languages using multiple language front-ends and a
common compiler back-end. The gcc3-c-devel pkg provides the common
components and is required by all the other gcc3-*-devel pkgs.

This package was created for the rather large task of bringing the
Ada compiler into compiliance with the Ada Compiler Validation 
Suite (ACATS). Once that work is completed, and gcc 3.4 is released,
this package can be merged into gcc3-ada.
