This pkg builds the GNU Compiler Collection (GCC) version 3.4 Ada compiler.
This is a devepmental release. 

The pkg works with the other pkgs in the gcc3-*-devel set of packages to
support a number of languages using multiple language front-ends and a
common compiler back-end. The gcc3-c-devel pkg provides the common
components and is required by all the other gcc3-*-devel pkgs.
