GNU gettext provides the necessary tools and libraries for
handling messages in different languages, as one of the steps to
internationalisation (or i18n) of a utility.

This package provides the runtime libraries and programs for anyone who
wants to run internationalized programs.

It includes the gettext(1) tool for translating a natural language
message into user's native language, by looking up the translation in
a message catalog. And it provides the manual page documentation
for the gettext(3) related functions.
