Social Networks Visualizer (SocNetV) is a graphical and flexible application,
which allows you to draw and visualize social networks and compute network
statistics, i.e. distances, centralities, diameter etc.

Various network file formats are supported, such as GraphML, Adjacency, Pajek,
and GraphViz. You can modify an existing network, draw a new network using
your mouse or have SocNetV create random networks for you.

Furthermore, SocNetV can crawl an internet website for you and create
