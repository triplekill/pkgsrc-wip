pkg_online - client/server search in pkgsrc packages.

Every separate field (PKGPATH, PKGNAME, COMMENT etc.) may be queried
separately and multiple fields may be queried too. Lots of search
strategies are available. A set of fields and search strategies may
very depending on your server configuration. Search in multiple
"repositories" is supported too, e.g. search in binary repository
or in pkgsrc source tree.

Communication protocol is a well known dictionary protocol described
in RFC-2229. Server may run dictd or any other dictionary protocol
server you like.  For dictd see http://www.dict.org and
http://sourceforge.net/projects/dict

pkg_online has minimal amount of things specific to pkgsrc and can
easily be adapted to any other packageing systems.

Of course it is based on pkg_summary-utils ;-)
