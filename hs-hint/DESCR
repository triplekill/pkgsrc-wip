This library defines an Interpreter monad. It allows to load Haskell
modules, browse them, type-check and evaluate strings with Haskell
expressions and even coerce them into values. The library is
thread-safe and type-safe (even the coercion of expressions to
values). It is, esentially, a huge subset of the GHC API wrapped in a
simpler API. Works with GHC 6.10.x and 6.8.x (this version was not
tested with GHC 6.6).
