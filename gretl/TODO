1. List BLAS and FFTW 3 as dependencies.
2. Fix incorrect configuration for readline, it uses readline unconditionally.
3. Fix -ldl, it is ignored using hack currently.
4. "about.c:116: error: too many arguments to function 'gdk_pixbuf_new_from_file'"
No idea what's that. Report upstream.
(Delist gdk-pixbuf as no longer dependency?)
