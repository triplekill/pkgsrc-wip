Lmod is a Lua based module system. Modules allow for dynamic modification of
a user's environment under Unix systems.

See www.tacc.utexas.edu/tacc-projects/lmod for a complete description.

Lmod is a new implementation that easily handles the MODULEPATH Hierarchical
problem. It is drop-in replacement for TCL/C modules and reads TCL modulefiles
directly.
