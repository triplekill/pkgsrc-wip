OSSP var is a flexible, full-featured and fast variable construct expansion
library. It supports a configurable variable construct syntax very similar to
the style found in many scripting languages (like @name, ${name}, , etc.) and
provides both simple scalar (${name}) and array (${name[index]}) expansion, plus
optionally one or more post-operations on the expanded value (${name:op:op...}).

The supported post-operations are length determination, case conversion,
defaults, postive and negative alternatives, sub-strings, regular expression
based substitutions, character translations, and padding. Additionally, a meta-
onstruct plus arithmetic expressions for index and range calculations allow
(even nested) iterations over array variable expansions
(..[..${name[#+1]}..]..). The actual variable value lookup is performed through
a callback function, so OSSP var can expand arbitrary values.
