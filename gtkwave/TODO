- shared-mime-info should be 1.1 for the moment.
  for example:
    cd databases/shared-mime-info; cvs update -D 2013-10-01
    % cat databases/shared-mime-info/CVS/Tag
    D2013.09.30.15.00.00
  See 
  http://gnats.netbsd.org/48300

  The problem was:
    # /usr/pkg/bin/update-mime-database /usr/pkg/share/mime
    Bad file descriptor
    
    Then, mimedb is broken.
    
    Downgrade update-mime-database to 1.1 and mimedb is fixed.
    After that, gdk-pixbuf-csouce works and gdk2 is built fine.
  But this seems gone on 2014-01-01 with cvs update -dPA. 
  Investigating.
