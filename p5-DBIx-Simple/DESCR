DBIx::Simple provides a simplified interface to DBI,
Perl's powerful database module.

This module is aimed at rapid development and easy maintenance.
Query preparation and execution are combined in a single method
the result object (which is a wrapper around the statement
handle) provides easy row-by-row and slurping methods.

The query method returns either a result object, or a dummy object.
The dummy object returns undef (or a empty list) for all methods
when used in boolean context, is false. The dummy object
lets you postpone (or skip) error checking, but it also
makes immediate error checking simply
$db->query(...) or die $db->error
