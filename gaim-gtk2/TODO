Examine my use of locale in PLIST - it is currently consistent with the
existing gaim port but doesn't feel right.

Decide if we want chat/gaim and chat/gaim-gnome and chat/gaim-gtk2, or just
this version of gaim (0.60).  We'll need to adjust the Makefile's CONFLICTS
accordingly once that has been decided.

jmmv: If anyone is going to import this package into pkgsrc, I feel that our
      actual gaim{,-gnome} packages should be renamed to gaim-gtk1 or whatever
      and make the new one become just "gaim".  This way it will be easier for
      us to get rid of the older version in the future, if we need to.

Note that gaim 0.59 is now just going to have bug fixes imported, no new
features.  http://gaim.sf.net/faq.php

- Related to gnome2-dirs, if the PLIST should contain a directory which
  is handled in gnome2-dirs, I think it's good to add a @comment, so
  when updating the package one knows why the directory isn't there, i.e:
    @comment in gnome2-dirs: @dirrm whatever
