Examine my use of locale in PLIST - it is currently consistent with the
existing gaim port but doesn't feel right.

Decide if we want chat/gaim and chat/gaim-gnome and chat/gaim-gtk2, or just
this version of gaim (0.60).  We'll need to adjust the Makefile's CONFLICTS
accordingly once that has been decided.

Note that gaim 0.59 is now just going to have bug fixes imported, no new
features.  http://gaim.sf.net/faq.php
