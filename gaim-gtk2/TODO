Examine my use of locale in PLIST - it is currently consistent with the
existing gaim port but doesn't feel right.

Decide if we want chat/gaim and chat/gaim-gnome and chat/gaim-gtk2, or just
this version of gaim (0.60).  We'll need to adjust the Makefile's CONFLICTS
accordingly once that has been decided.

jmmv: If anyone is going to import this package into pkgsrc, I feel that our
      actual gaim{,-gnome} packages should be renamed to gaim-gtk1 or whatever
      and make the new one become just "gaim".  This way it will be easier for
      us to get rid of the older version in the future, if we need to.

Note that gaim 0.59 is now just going to have bug fixes imported, no new
features.  http://gaim.sf.net/faq.php

- Replace USE_X11BASE with USE_X11.  Do not use the former if you don't
  know what you are doing.  Then rebuild and check if everything works.

- You USE_LIBTOOL, but there is no LIBTOOL_OVERRIDE...

- The gtkspell thing is bad.  Either enable it or not.  Do not try
  to see if it's installed to adjust the behavior of the package.  So the
  maintainer decides... anyway, what does it do?

- Remove the inclusion of perl5/buildlink2.mk (I'm not completely sure
  about this, though), and use USE_PERL5 (the variable can be set either
  to YES or "build", the later if you want a BUILD_DEPENDS only).  I see
  --enable-perl, what does it do?

- Remove the blank line at the end of Makefile.

- Could you reformat the COMMENT so it doesn't include an apostrophe?
  vim doesn't know how to colorize it properly ;)

- Depend on the latest gnome2-dirs version, that is, 1.1.

- Related to gnome2-dirs, if the PLIST should contain a directory which
  is handled in gnome2-dirs, I think it's good to add a @comment, so
  when updating the package one knows why the directory isn't there, i.e:
    @comment in gnome2-dirs: @dirrm whatever
