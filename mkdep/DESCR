This is a mkdep. It constructs Makefile dependency lists.

Because it is a C program and does all postprocessing and file
handling without calling any external programs, it is up to 10-percent
faster than the original BSD mkdep shell script.

This is NetBSD's version of mkdep originally coded by Matthias Scheler.
