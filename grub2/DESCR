This is the second version of the GRand Unified Bootloader, rewritten
from scratch to make GNU GRUB cleaner, safer, more robust, more powerful,
and more portable.

GRUB 2 currently runs on i386 and macppc, and groks many filesystems
(e.g. ext2, fat, ufs, minix, iso9660, jfs, hfs). It is able to load and
boot Multiboot (1 and 2) and Linux (bzImage and zImage) kernels and
chainload foreign operating systems' bootsectors.
