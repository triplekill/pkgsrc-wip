Remove NetBSD patches when official GNU GRUB release supports NetBSD.
Handle configuration file with SYSCONF when grub supports it.
Test GRUB on supported architectures and port it to other.
Make fixed locations like '/grub' configurable when GRUB does so.
Stay current.
Our patches are 500K, which is really big. It is because NetBSD port was
not made against the release, but against current.
check MASTER_SITE and add mirrors
add plattform dependencies
resolve grub-install conflict with grub legacy. probably call grub utils
grub2-* to prevent confusion?
