GRUB 2 is in relatively early development stage and is still neither
complete nor well tested. Anyways, just installing this package can do no
harm.

To actually install GRUB to disk, use grub-setup utility. Do not do it
unless you understand what does it actually do, for it may lead to loss of
data when used improperly. Refer to the address below for more information.

Be sure co consult GRUB wiki at http://grub.enbug.org/ before using GRUB.
This website should be also considered primary source of information about
GRUB until the manual is complete.

Using package emulator/qemu for testing GRUB is a good idea, indeed.

Enjoy GRUB. Your feedback is welcome.
