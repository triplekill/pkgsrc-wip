* Fix following conflict (with wip/cygwin-binutils)
(1)
  ===> Install binary package of nios2-binutils-2.15
  pkg_add: Conflicting PLIST with cygwin-binutils-2.20: info/as.info

(By the way, wip/cygwin-* does not include -gcc yet).
  --> This will be fixed by having divided cross-binutils-info ?

(2)
Conflicting PLIST with cross-binutils-2.17.0.0nb1: lib/libiberty.a
