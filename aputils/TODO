- Use MASTER_SITE_SOURCEFORGE instead of listing mirrors independantly.

- Use a single space in .include lines, not tabs.

- Set USE_BUILDLINK2.

- Many lines in the DESCR file have trailing whitespace.  Fix it.

- The package installs locale files, so set USE_PKGLOCALEDIR.

- The lib/charset.alias file must not be in the PLIST.  If the package is
  touching this file, I guess some dependancy is missing...
