	Xgfe is a GUI front end to the Gnuplot plotting package. It is
developed under Linux, is written in C++, and uses the Qt v1.32 widget set.
using Gnuplot is easier with xgfe. It does not currently support every
option of Gnuplot, but it supports many things.
	Xgfe does offer the ability to type commands directly to Gnuplot
so its full capabilites (theoretically) are available through the GUI.
