Suggestion:

Because SciPy offers stand-alone modules (like already comited py-weave,
they also have module for Chaco, for sure), in future it would be good to
check if the package can be split.

Eg. you'd have py-SciPy installing just scipy* - and weave, kivo,
chaco would be dependencies.

But, it needs investigation. I don't know, if 5 standalone modules,
put together, would make the same software SciPy is.
