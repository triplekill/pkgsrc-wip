datapipe.c is a simple program that allows a listening TCP/IP port to be
constructed on the machine it is running on.  Any connections to that port
will then be forwarded to the specified remote host and remote port.  This
program can be useful for allowing your Distributed.net clients
communicate to the outside world by running it on a gateway machine that
has access to both the inside firewall and the outside realworld.
