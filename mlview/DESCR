The MlView project is an on going effort to develop an xml editor for 
GNOME environment. It is written in C and uses the gnome libraries (libxml2, 
gtk+, libgnome*, etc).

Some features ...

 * cut/copy/paste as child/paste as prev/paste as next/ of xml elements
 * xml element/attributes search
 * multi docs edition
 * Several editing views can be opened on the same document
 * drag and drop based copy/cut/past of xml elements
 * edition of xml elements and attributes can be made directly on the tree
 * namespace support
 * on-demand validation
 * graphical error reporting. Parse/validation time errors reported graphically.
   This feature is new so it may be buggy or not well polished ...
 * when validation is switched on, MlView proposes an elements/attributes 
   completion feature. When an element is added to the tree, MlView also adds the 
   children elements required by the DTD for the document to be valid.
 * Validation can be switched off. The xml document editon can then be done 
   without any constraint.
 * a clean code ;)
