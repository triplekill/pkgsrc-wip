should the comment be: Simple QT-based financial manager  ??

update DESCR to list some of these features
 http://qhacc.sourceforge.net/features.html

test under NetBSD

a KDE integrated version is available too, called KHacc

make a MESSAGE about --create for a new configuration

todo: suggest to developers that it create the QHACC_HOME (~/.qhacc)
automatically and have GUI populate it with contrib/easysetup (or whatever)
as needed

share/qhacc/extras/qhacccvs.sh is this needed? /bin/sh instead?
