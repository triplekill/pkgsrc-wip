Multiple problems on NetBSD:
* does not parse options correctly:
  "-b 128", "--bitrate=128" not recognized
  "-h", "-V" cause core dumps
* does not handle two path arguments like usage suggests
  mp3fs /a /b
  errors out; one of the patches works around this, but that's
  not a solution and I don't know how it's supposed to work
* after working around these problems, does not transcode
  files -- just copies flac files
