This directory is a testbed for new .mk files, that could propably be
introduced to pkgsrc/mk/ after testing/development/reviewing/quarantine.

Please have in mind, that files you put here must be really well-documented,
Doing this you raise the chance the file will be reviewed.

The need for their existance must be also important.

For settings, that are shared between only a few packages, create
"Makefile.common" (see pkgsrc/databases/postgresql for example)
