Please provide .mk files descriptions and reasons for existence of those
files here.

linuxbin.pkg.mk	- generalised .mk file for installing Linux binary packages,
		  for various architectures, no matter - deb or rpm.
		  Introduced by Michal Pasternak <dotz@irc.pl>
		  
		  Why:
		  - pkgsrc contains many packages, that use RPM files
		  - current emul/suse_linux/ layer provided by Makefile.common
		    is no good (can't override path for RPMFILES, for example)
		  - could be used by emul/linux base packages as well


win32.pkg.mk	- this is winpkgsrc base makefile; it is a base of all
		  packages, that are cross-compiled with mingw32. Do not
		  use it with normal packages by any means.

rcd.mk          - this file is intended to determine if build system
		  have an rc.d framework, or not. In case if there
		  is no such one, it will be installed from pkgsrc
		  by dependency.

postgresql.mk	- improvement for current postgresql-* packages; should reside
		  in databases/postgresql/ directory and not mk.
