You should also modify your PATH variable to include the installation
directory, or copy the gtkada-config script somewhere in your path
     
   $ setenv PATH <installation_directory>:$PATH
or
   $ export PATH=<installation_directory>:$PATH
     
Finally, update your LD_LIBRARY_PATH variable to include that
directory, so that the linker can find the libraries.  The other
alternative if you have access to root priviledges is to add this
'prefix' directory added in /etc/ld.conf and then run ldconfig.
     
Then, when you want to compile your application, simply use the
gtkada-config script:
     
   $ gnatmake <your_application> <your_switches> `gtkada-config`

This will automatically submit the correct paths to gnatmake so that
the gtk and gtkada libraries are found.
