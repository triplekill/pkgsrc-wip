- The software library builds, however, I'm encountering
  an error while linking the test driver:

gnatlink -o gate-in.exe -L. -lgtkada -Wl,-R/usr/pkg/lib -Wl,--export-dynamic -L/usr/pkg/lib -lgtk-x11-2.0 -lgdk-x11-2.0 -latk-1.0 -lgdk_pixbuf-2.0 -lpangoxft-1.0 -lpangox-1.0 -lpango-1.0 -lgobject-2.0 -lgmodule-2.0 -lglib-2.0 -lintl -lm -lgcc gate.ali
/usr/bin/ld: gate-in.exe: hidden symbol `__enable_execute_stack' in /usr/pkg/gcc3/lib/gcc-lib/i386--netbsdelf2.0/3.3.2/libgcc.a(_trampoline.oS) is referenced by DSO

  The comments in src/gnu/dist/binutils/bfd/elflink.h indicate that
  this error message means that __enable_execute_stack is being called
  from a shared library. The library, libgcc.a, is a static
  library. The procedure, __enable_execute_stack, is called as part of
  it's initialialization.
