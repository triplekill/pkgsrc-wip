This is GtkAda version 2.2.1. This package is an Ada95 graphical library
for the Gimp Toolkit, which means this is a set of packages to allow you
to easily create some graphical interfaces under X11 and Win32, using Ada95
as a programming language.

Every widget from gtk 2.2 has been bound, and the test
program found in the gtk release has been reimplemented in Ada (have a
look at the testgtk/ directory).
