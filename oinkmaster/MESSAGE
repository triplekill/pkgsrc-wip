You will receive two false positives about classification.config and
reference.config as oinkmaster expects these files to be in 
${PREFIX}/share/snort/rules.  To resolve this enter the following
commands:

 ln -s ${PKG_SYSCONFDIR}/snort/classification.config \
	${PREFIX}/share/snort/rules/classification.config
 ln -s ${PKG_SYSCONFDIR}/snort/reference.config \
	${PREFIX}/share/snort/rules/reference.config
