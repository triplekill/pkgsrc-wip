We present a software package based on a new probabilistic model for random
graphs called MixNet (Erdos-Renyi Mixture for Networks). This model is based on
the hypothesis that real networks are made of classes which show specific
connectivity patterns. We compute algorithms to estimate the model's parameters
as well as a statistical criterion ICL to select the number of classes
