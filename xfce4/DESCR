XFce 4 is the next generation of the popular XFce desktop.

This package does not contain anything by itself -- it is a
"meta-package" that depends on other XFce4 packages. Its sole
purpose is to require dependencies so users can install this
package only and have all the XFce stuff pulled in by the package
dependency mechanism.
