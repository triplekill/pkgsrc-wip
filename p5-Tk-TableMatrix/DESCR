Tk::TableMatrix is a table/matrix widget extension to Perl/Tk for displaying
data in a table (or spreadsheet) format.  The basic features of the widget are:

* Multi-line cells
* Support for embedded windows (one per cell)
* Row & column spanning
* Variable width columns / height rows (interactively resizable)
* Row and column titles
* Multiple data sources ((perl hash|| perl callback) &| internal caching)
* Supports standard Tk reliefs, fonts, colors, etc.
* X/Y scrollbar support
* 'tag' styles per row, column or cell to change visual appearance
* In-cell editing - returns value back to data source
* Support for disabled (read-only) tables or cells (via tags)
* Multiple selection modes, with "active" cell
* Multiple drawing modes to get optimal performance for larger tables
* Optional 'flashes' when things update
* Cell validation support
* Works everywhere Tk does (including Windows and Mac!)
