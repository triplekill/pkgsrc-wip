jed (programmer's editor)

JED (by John E. Davis) is an extremely powerful but small emacs-like
programmer's editor that is extensible in a C-like macro language and
can do color syntax highlighting.  Among the many features:
    Emacs, wordstar, EDT emulation;
    C, Fortran, TeX, text editing modes;  Full undo;
    GNU Emacs compatible info reader, and lots more.

JED is also 8 bit clean, so you can even edit binary files!
