Gune is a C utility library which allows you to program in a more high-level
way.  It contains often-needed functionality which is rewritten time and
again by C programmers.  People keep re-inventing the wheel and each time
this is done, new bugs are created.  This is totally unnecessary and that's
why we've created Gune as a one-stop solution for most widely-used
functionality.
