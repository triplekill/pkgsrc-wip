Bump 4.5.3 to 4.7.3
For the changes for 4.7, see following page.
  http://gcc.gnu.org/gcc-4.7/changes.html

(Picking up AVR related topic from above info):
The AVR port's libgcc has been improved and its multilib
structure has been enhanced. As a result, all objects
contributing to an application must either be compiled with
GCC versions up to 4.6.x or with GCC versions 4.7.1 or
later. If the compiler is used with AVR Libc, you need a
version that supports the new layout, i.e. implements #35407.

The AVR port's -mshort-calls command-line option has been
deprecated. It will be removed in the GCC 4.8 release. See
-mrelax for a replacement.

The AVR port only references startup code that clears .bss and
the common section resp. initializes the .data and .rodata
section provided respective sections (or subsections thereof)
are not empty, see PR18145. 
  Applications that put all static storage objects into
non-standard sections and / or define all static storage
objects in assembler modules, must reference __do_clear_bss
resp. __do_copy_data by hand or undefine the symbol(s) by
means of -Wl,-u,__do_clear_bss resp. -Wl,-u,__do_copy_data.
