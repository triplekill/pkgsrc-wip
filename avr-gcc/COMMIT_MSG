(pkgsrc)
Removing:
 patches/patch-aa
   (was not to install: install-subdir at libiberty)
 patches/patch-ac
   (was not to install tree-inline.o cppdefault.o for Mac OS X,
    equivalent target does not have these files for now)
 patches/patch-gcc_toplev.h
   Upstream corrected the problem as:
   -extern inline int
   +static inline int

Adding:
 patch-gcc_config_avr_driver-avr_c
   To fix the problem like:
   error: non-void function 'avr_device_to_arch' should return a value [-Wreturn-type]
 patch-libiberty_Makefile.in
   Not install libiberty.a
   to avoid duplication (conflict) with other cross tool-chain (mef@).
 
(upstream)
