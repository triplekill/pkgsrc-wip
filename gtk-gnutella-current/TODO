Somehow handle https type urls in the subversion module. It works if
the user building the package has already saved the certificate in her
homedirectory. This has however never happened during bulk builds, or
from within a pkg_comp chroot. That is why this package always fails
to build in the pkgsrc-wip bulk builds.
