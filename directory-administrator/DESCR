Directory administrator is not a comprehensive and technical tool (e.g.
Novell ConsoleOne). On the contrary, Directory administrator minimizes
what's shown and maximizes functionality and ease of use.

Directory administrator is built for everyday system management: technical
expertise is not mandatory. Not even understanding how an LDAP directory
works is needed. Fire it up, create, delete and change your users and groups,
and that's it. Features such as type ahead find and keyboard navigation let
you quickly locate what you're looking for, while drag-and-drop and multiple
selections make your job easier,

In tandem with OpenLDAP or any other directory server, you can deploy a
solution equivalent to Microsoft's Active Directory, with no proprietary
traps, zero licensing fees and using secure, freely distributed software.
