k5start aquires kerberos credentials and runs a command
with those credentials. If the kerberos credentials are
obtained from a keytab k5start can be configured to
wake up every so often and renew the obtained credentials.
It can also optionally run a command every time
credentials are obtained (for example, you could run
afslog when credentials are obtained).
