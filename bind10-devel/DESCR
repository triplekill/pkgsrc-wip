BIND is the popular implementation of a DNS server, developer
interfaces, and DNS tools. BIND 10 is a rewrite of BIND 9. BIND 10
is written in C++ and Python and provides a modular environment
for serving, maintaining, and developing DNS.

BIND10-devel is new development leading up to the production
BIND 10 release. It contains prototype code and experimental
interfaces. Nevertheless it is ready to use now for testing the
new BIND 10 infrastructure ideas.
