The Mutt E-Mail Client by Michael Elkins <me@cs.hmc.edu>

``All mail clients suck.  This one just sucks less.'' -me, circa 1995

Mutt is a small but very powerful text-based MIME mail client.Mutt
is highly configurable, and is well suited to the mail power user with
advanced features like key bindings, keyboard macros, mail threading,
regular expression searches and a powerful pattern matching language
for selecting groups of messages.

This is the latest current version of mutt with extra patches.
