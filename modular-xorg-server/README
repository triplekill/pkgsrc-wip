ATTENTION NetBSD-current users (those with userland atomic ops):

In order to achieve maximum benefits from this package, please
apply the following patch for x11/libdrm, making sure to build
graphics/MesaLib with the updated xf86drm.h.

<ftp://ftp.NetBSD.org/pub/NetBSD/misc/bjs/patches/libdrm-atomic.diff>

This will teach the [userland] dri drivers, mesa, and the X server's glxdri
how to use atomic_cas_uint() for DRM_CAS.

Also, if you're curious, you may try defining the MESA_EXECMEM_WIRED
environment variable in your .xinitrc [or equivlent].  This will cause
the heap used for glx/DRI in the X server and mesa to be wired down.
