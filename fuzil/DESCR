Fusil is a fuzzing framework designed to expose bugs in software by changing
random bits of its input.

It helps to start process with a prepared environment (limit memory, environment
variables, redirect stdout, etc.), start network client or server, and create
mangled files. Fusil has many probes to detect program crash: watch process exit
code, watch process stdout and syslog for text patterns
(eg. "segmentation fault"), watch session duration, watch cpu usage (process
and system load), etc.

Fusil is based on a modular architecture. It computes a session score used
to guess fuzzing parameters like number of injected errors to input files.
