RSS-GLib is a wrapper around the fantastic libmrss library for parsing
rss, atom, and other syndications.  The reason for this was two-fold.
The libmrss, while quite powerful, is a little more complex than needed
for most projects.  For this reason RSS-GLib aims to wrap that into a
simpler API.  The primary reason, however, is that gobject is so easy
to wrap into various languages
