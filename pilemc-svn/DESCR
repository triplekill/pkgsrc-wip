 PileMC is a tool for the simulation of pile-up events at HepMC level.
Technically, PileMC reads two HepMC files, one of which contains signal events
and the other one contains minimum-bias events. The program generates a HepMC
file containing signal events superimposed with min-bias events,
yielding an event-generator-level approximation to the presence
of pile-up in high-luminosity collisions.
