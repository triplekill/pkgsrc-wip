Test::Assertions::TestScript provides a base for writing test scripts. It
performs some common actions such as setting up the @INC path and parsing
command-line options, specifically:

* The lib and t/lib directories are added to @INC.
* The current directory is changed to the directory the script is in.
* Test script command-line options are parsed. (See "COMMAND-LINE OPTIONS")
* The test set of functions from Test::Assertions are imported into your test
  script.

Test::Assertions::TestScript makes certain assumptions about the filesystem
layout of your project:

* Modules that you are testing are in the lib directory of your project.
* There may also be a t/lib directory for any modules written for the test
  process.
