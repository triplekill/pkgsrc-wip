update to newest version

FATAL: ldconfig must be used with "||${TRUE}".
(that is bug in pkglint.)

make sure gcc exists (see very bottom of Makefile)

thread about missing stdarg.h
 http://www.ussg.iu.edu/hypermail/linux/kernel/0209.3/1015.html 
For time being I run kernel make like this:
   GCC_EXEC_PREFIX=/usr/app/gcc/lib/gcc-lib/ make

make package for linux-kernel-headers too
 ${MAKE} include/linux/version.h
glibc provides its own <net/*> and <scsi/*> header files to replace them
so just include/asm and include/linux

message to suggest running lilo if using LILO

maybe dynamically figure out modules for PLIST

LOCALBASE should be / for PLIST to be right
(need to use LOCLABASE for the install part too.)

should install .config file too; for example:
Knoppix kernel-headers-2.4.22-xfs_10.00.Custom_i386.deb
ar p ../kernel-headers-2.4.22-xfs_10.00.Custom_i386.deb data.tar.gz | tar zxf -
and found usr/src/kernel-headers-2.4.22-xfs/.config

try to just install headers with make config followed by make include/linux/version.h

copy certain directories from include to /usr/include

look at default /boot/config-2.2.20-idepci

# cp -i arch/i386/boot/bzImage /bzImage.-- with kernel-version- or other name
#   maybe copy to boot directory (as lilo also knows it)
