SphinxSE is MySQL storage engine which can be compiled into MySQL server 5.x
using its pluggable architecure. It is not available for MySQL 4.x series. It
also requires MySQL 5.0.22 or higher in 5.0.x series, or MySQL 5.1.12 or
higher in 5.1.x series.

Despite the name, SphinxSE does not actually store any data itself. It is
actually a built-in client which allows MySQL server to talk to searchd, run
search queries, and obtain search results. All indexing and searching happen
outside MySQL.
