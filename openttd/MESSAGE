$NetBSD$
To run openttd you *NO LONGER* need data files provided by the original
Transport Tycoon Deluxe. If you wouls still prefer to use the proprietary
original data files, unset the openttd-data option of the package, and
do the following:

The following files should be copied to ${PREFIX}/share/openttd/data
in order to play:

	sample.cat
	trg1r.grf
	trgcr.grf
	trghr.grf
	trgir.grf
	trgtr.grf

All *.gm files should be copied to ${PREFIX}/share/openttd/gm
in order to play original MIDI music.

Note: On NetBSD playing MIDI music is not supported now. Probably in a
future version.
