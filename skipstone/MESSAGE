$NetBSD$

To download files from the Internet, SkipStone by default uses SkipDownload
(included in this packages), which in turn invokes wget.  For this to work,
you  must install the net/wget package,  but since it's not strictly needed
for SkipStone to run, it's not added as a dependency for this package.  You
can change the download program via Settings -> Preferences -> Helper Apps.
