Gotmail is a script to download mail from hotmail.com without user 
interaction. It's probably best run from a cron job. It can delete messages,
download only-new messages, mark messages read (or not), forward to procmail, 
to another address, or send through SMTP.

Hotmail periodically makes small changes in the way its site works, and 
corresponding changes are made to gotmail as expeditiously as possible. 
However, there will be periods of time during which gotmail will not work, 
due to these changes. Please be patient, and don't rely on gotmail being in 
working condition at all times.
