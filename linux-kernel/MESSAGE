The ${PKGBASE} package can be installed simultaneously with
other Linux kernel packages at the same time. You can manually remove
older versions with pkg_delete(8) when they aren't needed anymore.

Be sure to adjust your grub.conf and/or lilo.conf (and re-run lilo)
boot loader configuration as necessary for your system.
