Glista aims to be a very simple personal to-do list manager
or task tracking tool that does what it's supposed to
and does not get in your way

Glista is based on the Gtk+ graphical toolkit which means it will
integrate best with the GNOME desktop and other Gtk+ based desktop
environments, but will also run well on other environments such as KDE
