$NetBSD$

Tivoli Storage Manager Client has been installed in
		${EMULDIR}/opt/tivoli
with binaries in
		${EMULDIR}/${TSMCLIENTSUBDIR}/ba/bin
and configuration in
		${PKG_SYSCONFDIR}
The documentation (html and pdf) has been installed in
		${EMULDIR}/opt/tivoli/tsm/client/books.

NetBSD configuration hints:

- TSM expects ${EMULDIR}/etc/mtab to exist and be meaningful.
  Making it a syslink to /proc/mounts works on NetBSD 3 or
  newer, if you mount procfs like
  >> procfs  /emul/linux/proc  procfs  ro,linux  0 0 <<
  in /etc/fstab.
  Alternatively, make ${EMULDIR}/etc/mtab a symlink to /etc/fstab.

- The suse_base package sets up ${EMULDIR}/etc/mtab as a symlink
  to ${EMULDIR}/proc/mounts. Make sure it links to /proc/mounts
  instead for NetBSD 5 and newer, or dsmc will die an early
  ANS1030E death.

- Make sure the 'passworddir' variable is set in tsm.sys so that the
  passwd file ends up in ${PKG_SYSCONFDIR} instead of the shadow
  hierarchy.

- The environment variables DSM_DIR, DSM_CONFIG, DSM_LOG
  need to be set properly. DSM_LOG may inadvertently end up in the
  emul shadow hierarchy, unless you make ${EMULDIR}/var/log
  a symbolic link to /../var/log/.
  There is a sample start script in ${PREFIX}/share/examples/tsm.

- For backing up the native filesystem hierarchy, use a construct
  like "ln -s / /.`hostname`" to break out of the emul shadow
  hierarchy.
