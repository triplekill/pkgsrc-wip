## Urgent

- Get some testing.
- Copy dsm.{sys,opt}.smp to share/examples/tivoli.
- tsm aborts with weird error if the DSM_CONFIG file is not found.
- tsm wants /etc/mtab as a link to native /etc/fstab. Document that.
- Populate etc/tivoli (dsm.{sys,opt}, and don't forget the 
  en_US -> /emul/linux/opt/tivoli/tsm/client/ba/bin/en_US/ symlink)
- Notify the admin that the environment variables DSM_DIR, DSM_CONFIG, DSM_LOG 
  have to be set properly. DSM_LOG may end up in the emul shadow hierarchy.
- Notify the admin that she needs a construct like 'ln -s / /.mymachine' 
  to break out of the emul shadow hierarchy.


## Less urgent

- Add other architectures (linuxppc, solaris, ...)
- Find a better way of adding library paths to the linux /etc/ld.so.conf
