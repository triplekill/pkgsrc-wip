Aesthete is an attempt to provide a Python-based fully-featured,
innovative  integrated mathematical environment, as a frontend to sympy,
scipy and numpy. Aesthete is not intended as a GUIfied replacement
for MATLAB (if that is  what you are looking for, try QtOctave or SAGE).
Instead it focuses on providing basic, unscripted maths processing
and presentation.
