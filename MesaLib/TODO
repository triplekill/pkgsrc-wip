 $NetBSD: TODO,v 1.3 2013/05/16 05:22:02 richard Exp $

 Here is a [possibly non-exhaustive] list of issues to resolve prior 
 to the next quarterly freeze:

 - Add/verify platform-specific values to use when restoring the FPU
   control word.

 - The Mesa master branch uses autoconf.  Unfortunately, last I checked, 
   they do not use it to enable the heap allocator, nor use of floating-point 
   functions in libm, etc.  Perhaps we should take a field trip to the 
   autoconf archive and write some of the m4 code required to implement 
   these tests.  After all, pkgsrc is uncommon in that we do not 
   assume the entire world conforms to the behavior of (recent?) Linux 
   "distros".

 - I have not packaged the new MesaDemos yet due to lack of time.

 - verify and update BUILDLINK_API_DEPENDS

 - the following platforms are dealt with in PLIST for the libGL.so and 
   libGLw.so: 'Linux' | 'OpenBSD' | 'DragonFly' | 'GNU' | GNU/* | 'NetBSD'
   and 'SunOS'.  Any other platforms may need to have a look in
   ${WRKSRC}/bin/mklib and perhaps notice how SunOS was updated via the
   patchfile patch-bin_mklib.
