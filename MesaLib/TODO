 - Add/verify platfform-specific values for NPXCW.

 - Make sure my modifications to src/mesa/main/execmem.c do not introduce
   any regressions.

 - Currently, enabling the mmap-based allocator of anonymous executable
   memory (versus simply using malloc()) is handled by PKG_OPTIONS.  This
   is probably not appropriate.

 - The Mesa master branch uses autoconf (alas, no automake).  Unfortunately,
   last I checked they do not use it to enable mmapping anonymous memory,
   nor use of floating-point functions in libm, etc.  Perhaps we should
   take a field trip to the autoconf archive and write some of the trivial
   m4 code required to implement these tests.  After all, pkgsrc is unique
   in that we do not assume the entire world conforms to the behavior
   of (recent?) Linux "distros".

 - Check to see if HZ is actually used anywhere.  A cursory grepping
   of the code found nothing.

 - Once we settle on which build-time configuration variables we will
   use, document them and/or add them to mk/defaults/mk.conf.

 - The xcb (X C Bindings, not X Cut Buffer, heh) support is currently 
   disabled ...

 - Oh, and did I mention more testing? ;)
