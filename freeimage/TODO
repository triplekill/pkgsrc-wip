This package does not use any type of configure script has only been 
tried with NetBSD. Does it build correctly on other platforms? 
Also endianess might be a issue README.solaris in the distfile says that 
-DBYTE_ORDER=BIG_ENDIAN -D__BIG_ENDIAN__ is needed to build under 
solaris/sparc. The commiter of the package does not have
access to a big endian machine. If you have access to a big endian 
machine please try the package and report your experience to the 
commiter and/or to the pkgsrc-wip-discuss mailing list.
