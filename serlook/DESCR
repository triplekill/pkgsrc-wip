serlook is a tool aimed to inspect and debug serial line data traffic
developed in a Linux+KDE environment.

It can work as a classic point-to-point serial terminal mode or as a
line snooper , monitoring the data exchanged between two hosts
(needs a PCs equipped with at least two serial ports and a derived cable).
