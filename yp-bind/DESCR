ypbind-mt is a complete new implementation of a NIS binding daemon
for Linux and Solaris. It supports ypbind protocol V1 and V2, supports
multiple domain bindings, uses threads for better response, supports
/var/yp/binding/* file, supports a list of known secure NIS servers
(etc/yp.conf), and binds to the server which answers first.

ypbind is used to setup an NIS client.
