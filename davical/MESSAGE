Please refer to the following file if you need further information
regarding DAViCal's installation.

	${DOCDIR}/INSTALL

For pkgsrc installations, DAViCal's package is installed in non-default
locations.

	Document root:		${DAVICALDIR}

To complete the installation of DAViCal, follow these steps:

1. Create DAViCal's database

       su pgsql ${DAVICALDIR}/dba/create-database.sh

2. Edit pg_hba.conf file to add the davical_app user close to the
top of the accounts

	local   davical     davical_app   trust

3. Edit DAViCal configuration file, which resides under

	${PKG_SYSCONFDIR}/config.php

   It contains all the data needed by DAViCal PHP scripts to set up
   its environment, including database access.

4. You will need to make DAViCal accessible through your HTTP server.
   If you are running Apache, edit DAViCal's configuration file:

	${PKG_SYSCONFDIR}/davical.conf

   When finished, you can add an Include directive directly within Apache
   configuration file:

	Include ${PKG_SYSCONFDIR}/davical.conf

   then restart Apache. After this step, you should be able to access
   DAViCal through the URL mentionned within DAViCal's configuration file
   (XXX XXX by default).
