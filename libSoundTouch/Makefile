# For some reason this library contains a config/ directory with
# lots of broken symlinks.  Remove them here and add new one using
# patches/patch-ac.  Files were taken from Audacity, which is
# distributed with it's own version of SoundTouch. The patch was
# taken from FreeBSD Ports.
# Note: Probably we should split patch-ac or create it from scratch,
#       but it would be a lot better if it was fixed upstream.
