Bump dejagnu 1.4.4 to 1.5
-------------------------
Changes since 1.4.4:

1. The runtest.1 man page has been brought up to date.
2. The Docbook/SGML documentation files were removed in favour of the
   Docbook/XML documentation.  The Texinfo source for the Info pages is
   now automatically generated from the Docbook source.
3. The Makefile structure has been substantially simplified.  There
   is now a single top-level Makefile.am.  The use of recursive make
   has been eliminated.
4. lib/mondfe.exp and lib/xsh.exp have been removed.  Users requiring
   these communication modes can still use the DejaGnu 1.4 branch or
   can contact dejagnu@gnu.org to discuss reinstating these files.
5. The configure script now ensures that Expect is installed and that
   it is linked against Tcl 8.3 or greater.
6. The runtest program now gracefully handles the possibility of the
   expect binary vanishing after DejaGnu has been installed (for
   example, by the user altering their PATH).
7. The user-visible utility procedures `absolute', `prune', `psource'
   and `slay' are deprecated and will be removed in the next release.
   If a testsuite uses any of these procedures, a copy of the
   procedure should be made and placed in the lib directory of the
   testsuite.
