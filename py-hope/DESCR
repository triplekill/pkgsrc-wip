HOPE is a specialized method-at-a-time JIT compiler written in Python for
translating Python source code into C++ and compiles this at runtime
In contrast to other existing JIT compliers, which are designed for general
purpose, we have focused our development of the subset of the Python language
that is most relevant for astrophysical calculations.
By concentrating on this subset, HOPE is able to achieve the highest possible
performance
