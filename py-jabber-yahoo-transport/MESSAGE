You will need to customize the following file to get yahoo-transport
to work with jabber:

	${PKG_SYSCONFDIR}/yahoo-transport.xml

Quick start for jabberd2:

	Verify and update the following fields in
	${PKG_SYSCONFDIR}/yahoo-transport.xml:

	<jid></jid>		--  Set to the public name of the service
				    ex: yahoo.jabber.example
	<mainServer></mainServer>
				--  Set to the IP address of the main
				    jabber server
	<mainServerJID></mainServerJID>
				--  Set to the JID of the main server
				    (typically, something like
				     jabber.domain.example.)
	<secret></secret>	--  should be set to the legacy components
				    shared secret in jabber2's router.xml
				    (look for <secret>...</secret> in
				    router.xml)
				    Alternatively, the password when
				    using SASL component authentication.
				    (see router-users.xml for jabber2)
	<saslUsername></saslUsername>
			   	--  Set to the SASL user name to be used
				    to authenticate.  If not defined,
				    jabber2's legacy component
				    connection is used.  If defined,
				    <useRouteWrap/> should also be defined.
