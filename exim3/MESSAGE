To use exim, you will need to perform the following steps manually; it is
inappropriate for this package to make the changes for you.

1. Read the documentation. Edit ${PKG_SYSCONFDIR}/configure to taste.
   Note that depending on the version of NetBSD, the `aliases' file may
   be in /etc/mail and not /etc, as it was previously.

2. Back-up /etc/mailer.conf to /etc/mailer.conf.sendmail. Copy
   ${EGDIR}/mailer.conf to /etc/mailer.conf.

3. Set 'sendmail=NO', 'exim=YES' in /etc/rc.conf.

4. Configuring log rotation is dependant on personal taste and the version of
   NetBSD in use. See weekly.conf(5), newsyslog(8), exicyclog and eximstats.
