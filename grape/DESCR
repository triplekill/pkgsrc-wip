GRAPE is a GAP package for computing with graphs and groups, and is primarily
designed for constructing and analysing graphs related to groups, 
finite geometries, and designs. 

The vast majority of GRAPE functions are written entirely in the GAP language,
except for the automorphism group and isomorphism testing functions, which use
Brendan McKay's nauty package
