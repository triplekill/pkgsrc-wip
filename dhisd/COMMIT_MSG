 - Update 5.1 to 5.5
-----------------
On dhisd-5.5
	
	The server no longer requires a 5.4 client to have rport=0
	in order to reply to the sending port. This releases a small
	issue that broke 5.4 clients with servers <= 5.3. 
	As of this version, if the client's version is 5.4 or higher,
	the server always replies to the sending UDP port and disregards 
	rport. 5.5. clients however continue to fill in rport in order
	to be compatible with <= 5.3 servers.

On dhisd-5.4:

	The modular architecture has been dropped and the modules and
	engines are no longer part of dhisd. Instead dhisd is again 
	a DNS only updating daemon without engines; the extra functionality 
	provided by previous engines can however still be replicated with 
	OnCmd and OffCmd scripts on a per-host basis.

	The default configuration directory is now /usr/local/etc

	The default binaries directory is now /usr/local/sbin

	It is now possible to put all configuration parameters under a 
	config file; the default is /usr/local/etc/dhisd.conf 

	The pid file default location moved to /var/run/dhis/dhisd.pid

	The log file default location moved to /var/log/dhis/dhisd.log

	The server can now be bound to a specific IP address with either
	the BindAddr config option or the -b command line option.

	Multiple options have been added and are now possible with the 
	command line (dhisd -h) and the config file. 
	
	The server now binds to a UDP port (58800 by default) and sends
	UDP messages from that port; in previous versions dhisd sent
	UDP messages from a random port even though it listened on port 58000.

	In addition to the database text file (specified by the -d option 
	or the DBFile config option), dhisd can now use a MySQL database
	instead to achieve the same purpose of the dhis.db file. See
	README and INSTALL for details.
	
	This version of the server is compatible with NAT friendly 5.4 clients. 

On dhisd-5.3:

	Corrected bug that caused improper handling of comment character (;)
	in the database file.
