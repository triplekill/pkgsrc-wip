Xkill is a utility for forcing the X server  to  close  connections  to
clients.   This  program  is very dangerous, but is useful for aborting
programs that have displayed undesired windows on a user's screen.   If
no  resource identifier is given with -id, xkill will display a special
cursor as a prompt for the user to select a window to be killed.  If  a
pointer button is pressed over a non-root window, the server will close
its connection to the client that created the window.
