Argus is a system and network monitoring application.
It will monitor nearly anything you ask it to monitor
(TCP + UDP applications, IP connectivity, SNMP OIDS, Programs, Databases, etc).
It presents a nice clean, easy to view web interface
It can send alerts numerous ways (such as via pager) and can
automatically escalate if someone falls asleep.
