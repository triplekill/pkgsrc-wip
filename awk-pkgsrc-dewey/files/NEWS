Version 0.5.4, by Aleksey Cheusov

   FIX: alpha, beta etc. and letters are now case-insensitive.
   Though, case-insensitivity doesn't follow from pkg_info(1).
   It seems that they all are used as such.

   FIXED: another tricky dewey hack :-( It seems to me that `1A'
   should be equal to `1.A'. Right?

   FIX: It is not documented but it is in dewey.c: `_' should be
   treated as `.'. Right?

   FIX: Single letter can be placed not only at the end version or
   just before nb<NUM>. Now this is handled correctly.

   FIX: It is not properly documented but it seems to me that
   0001.00023.000456 1.23.456. Right?

Version <= 0.5.3, see CVS ChangeLog
