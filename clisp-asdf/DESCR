ASDF is Another System Definition Facility: a tool for specifying how systems
of Common Lisp software are comprised of components (sub-systems and files),
and how to operate on these components in the right order so that they can be
compiled, loaded, tested, etc.

This pkgsrc package is created for clisp.
