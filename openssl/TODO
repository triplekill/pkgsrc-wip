$NetBSD$

This package is just an update for security/openssl (0.9.7i) to its
latest release (0.9.8e). So far I only need it for wip/dkim-milter to
be able to use the rsa-sha256 signing algorithm on NetBSD/i386 3.1
systems. While this seems to work fine, this package definitely needs
more testing and should probably have some things fixed:

- patches/patch-a[ac]: I mainly copied over the changed/added configs
  from the pkgsrc patches and tested only on NetBSD/i386 (which
  configured as `BSD-x86-elf'). This should really be revisited...

- Are the pkglint(1) warnings safe to ignore?
