Execute "run-libmicro" to run the benchmark.

You can pipe the output of "run-libmicro" to a file, and process it later
via "multiview" when you need to generate an HTML report.

For example, suppose you want to compare two runs. You can do:

$ run-libmicro > output.1
$ run-libmicro > output.2
$ multiview output.1 output.2 > comparison.html

Then read 'comparison.html' in your favorite web browser.
