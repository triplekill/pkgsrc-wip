Decodes MO3 files back to their original format.

MO3 is a file format, encapsulating the features of several "MOD" formats
(IT / XM / S3M / MTM / MOD), but with one big difference - MP3 and OGG
compressed samples. A lossless codec is also incorporated for any samples
that don't like lossy encoding, and the whole file structure is compressed
too.

All this makes it possible to have great reductions in file sizes with
practically identical sound quality. Infact, MO3 allows greater quality
compositions because MP3/OGG encoding works best with 16-bit samples, so
there's no reason to use low quality 8-bit samples anymore.

The part that is not so great about MO3 is that the specification is
closed, and so is this software.
