The PDF::Reuse module could be used when you want to mass produce
similar (but not identical) PDF documents and reuse templates,
JavaScripts and some other components. It is functional to be fast,
and to give your programs capacity to produce many pages per second
and very big PDF documents if necessary.

The module produces PDF-1.4 files. Some features of PDF-1.5, like
"object streams" and "cross reference streams", are supported, but
only at an experimental level. More testing is needed.
