Modutils is a collection of utilities for managing Linux kernel
modules. These tools handle loadable Linux kernel module dependencies,
installing loadable modules in the running Linux kernel, report on Linux
kernel symbols, etc.

This installs the tools for Linux kernels before 2.5.48.  It installs
some tools named with .old extension so they can be installed at
the same time as the linux-module-init-tools package.
