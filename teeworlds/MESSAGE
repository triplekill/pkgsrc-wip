$NetBSD: $

This is a `meta-package' for teeworlds, it includes both server and client.

Because these packages install the same files they can not be installed at the
same time so install only the one that fits your needs.

If you only want teeworlds client install:
	wip/teeworlds-client

If you only want teeworlds server install:
	wip/teeworlds-server
