TODO
- NetBSD/i386 fails to compile on 6.0 to 6.99.18 (bsd-kvm.c)
- Dragonfly/i386 3.2.2: list command works, but cannot run programs 
- devel/gdb/patches/patch-* are not reviewed yet for inclusion
- Test on Dragonfly amd64, SunOS and Linux.
- Run make test on all platforms.

DONE
- NetBSD/amd64 6.1_RC1 and 6.99.19 OK with gcc/gfortran 4.8.0
  (make test passes more than 95 % of testcases).
- NetBSD/i386 5.2 invocation is OK (but does it work ?)
