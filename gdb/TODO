TODO
- Dragonfly/i386 3.2.2: list command works, but cannot run programs 
- NetBSD/i386 5.2 invocation reported as OK, but does it work ?
- Test on Dragonfly amd64, SunOS and Linux.
- Run make test on all platforms.
- devel/gdb/patches/patch-* are not reviewed yet for inclusion
- Run pkglint and do cleanup.
- Is the addition of libpthread_dbg necessary for full functionality
  as done by the gdb 7.3 in NetBSD src ?

DONE

- NetBSD/i386: 6.0 OK Tested with gcc 4.7 and make test passes 90 %
  of the testcases.
