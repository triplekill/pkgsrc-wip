* The package can be considered complete but there is no released
  source distribution of n2n, which means n2n itself is a wip.

* Darwin TunTap kext should be packaged as well, just like
  net/tuntap-solaris.

* Look at tuntap_netbsd.c:89:

    snprintf(buf, sizeof(buf), "ifconfig %s |grep address|cut -c 11-28", tap_device);

  This is... way too... fragile. We should instead use
  ioctl(SIOCGLIFADDR) on a PF_LINK socket but the problem is that
  SIOC* seems not to be documented at all.

* I have only tested it on NetBSD. tuntap_freebsd.c, tuntap_linux.c,
  tuntap_osx.c might be bitrotted just like tuntap_netbsd.c.
