* There is no released source distribution of n2n, which means n2n
  itself is in wip. We can indeed make a tarball from the git HEAD and
  put it to LOCAL_PORTS but I'm not sure that's a right thing to do.

* There are patches that should be sent to the upstream. See comments
  on patches/*

* edge(8) and supernode(1) should have a switch to create a
  pidfile. Our rc.d scripts are currently falling back to
  _find_processes, which is rather unsatisfactory.

* Darwin TunTap kext should be packaged as well, just like
  net/tuntap-solaris.

* Look at tuntap_netbsd.c:89:

    snprintf(buf, sizeof(buf), "ifconfig %s |grep address|cut -c 11-28", tap_device);

  This is... way too... fragile. We should instead use
  ioctl(SIOCGLIFADDR) on a PF_LINK socket but the problem is that
  SIOC* seems not to be documented at all.

* tuntap_freebsd.c should create a TAP interface automatically,
  probably by using ioctl(SIOCIFCREATE).

* Install gen_keyfile.py to support key-schedule file.
