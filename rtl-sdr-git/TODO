- rtl_fm is tested fine on NetBSD/amd64 6.1.4 with the command 
  rtl_fm -f 80.7M  | sudo env AUDIODEV=/dev/audio1 play -t raw -r 24k -es -b 16 -c 1 -V1 -
  (Select frequency instead of 80.7M, and audio device.  The 'play' is a part of audio/sox)

- shared-lib suffix (now 0 and 0.5git) should be parameterized
