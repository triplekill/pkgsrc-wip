The goals of the AIDA project are to define abstract interfaces for common
physics analysis objects, such as histograms, ntuples, fitters, IO etc.. The
adoption of these interfaces should make it easier for physicists to use
different tools without having to learn new interfaces or change all of their
code. Additional benefits will be interoperability of AIDA compliant
applications (for example by making it possible for applications to exchange
analysis objects via XML).
