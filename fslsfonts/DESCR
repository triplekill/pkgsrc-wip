Fslsfonts  lists  the fonts that match the given pattern.  The wildcard
character "*" may be used to match any sequence of characters  (includ-
ing  none),  and  "?"  to match any single character.  If no pattern is
given, "*" is assumed.

The "*" and "?" characters must be quoted to prevent  them  from  being
expanded by the shell.
