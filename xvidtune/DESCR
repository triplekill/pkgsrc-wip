Xvidtune  is  a  client  interface to the X server video mode extension
(XFree86-VidModeExtension).  When given one of the non-toolkit options,
xvidtune provides a command line interface to either switch the video mode.
Without any options--or with only toolkit options--it presents the user
with various buttons and sliders that  can  be  used  to  interactively
adjust existing video modes.  It will also print the settings in a for-
mat suitable for inclusion in an xorg.conf file.
