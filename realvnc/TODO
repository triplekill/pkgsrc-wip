** This package is not functional at this time.

RealVNC is the continuation of the original VNC project.  The old VNC
version in pkgsrc (3.3.3) is awfully outdated.  I made this package
to get the new version (4.0) on my machine.  RealVNC is a different
project than TightVNC.  The pkgsrc version is a much better package
than I could probably manage, so this is more just a standin.

The old version came with a customized Xfree tree to build Xvnc, the
VNC server that acts as a real X server with a virtual frambuffer.  The
new version does not.  It now requires the user to provide an entire 
XFree tree which is then patched and built.  It produces the VNC server
(Xvnc) and a regular X server that has VNC ablities built in.

I could have made a package that downloads the Xfree sources, and builds
everything, but I'm not sure this is appropriate, so I left it out,
which is why the package does not work at this time.

As it stands right now, the package will work if you "make" it.  It
will fail if you try to "make install" because the Xvnc executable is
not built.

If all you need is the viewer, the package will build fine, just go
into the makefile and remove the line that installs Xvnc.  If you want
to build the VNC server (I have done it), you have to "make" the package,
then go in and follow the directions in the README file.  Once Xvnc is
built, then do a "make install" and "make clean".

I can send you the Xvnc compiled for i386 NetBSD 1.6.2 if you have a
similar system and would like to save yourself the trouble.

** There is no IPv6 support like the pkgsrc version.

** It doesn't install any documentation, but it does download it.
