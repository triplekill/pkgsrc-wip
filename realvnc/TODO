- PACKAGE DOESNT BUILD
  There is something wrong with the build of XFree where the several
  files fail to compile.  The errors are ignored and when I go back
  to look at the files, the lines that caused errors are gone.  Going
  into xc/programs/Xserver and typing "make" causes it to finish the
  build just fine.  I think this problem may be with imake but I'll
  look later.

- Update package for security issue:
	http://secunia.com/advisories/15742/
  (dhowland)-updated to 4.1.1 but I dont think this will ever be fixed

- USE_PERL5 is deprecated.

- Doesn't install the shared module for X, the manpage, or the java
  classes for the webserver yet

- Allow an option to prevent the building of the X11 server
    (like FreeBSD ports)

  This package downloads and builds XFree 4.3.0 in order to create a
  VNC enabled X11 server.  The download is large, the work directory
  becomes very large, and the build takes a very long time.  It would
  be good to include a warning about this and include an option to
  safely turn off the building of the X server.

  Should also make a MESSAGE about this when it is done.

- Make the package more generalized (like FreeBSD ports)
  they do several replacements of "cc" and "cxx" with ${CC} and ${CXX}
  and stuff like that

- Still havn't looked into IPv6 support.
