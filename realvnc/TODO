- Update package for security issue:
	http://secunia.com/advisories/15742/
  (dhowland)-updated to 4.1.1 but I dont think this will ever be fixed

- We should be like vnc and tightvnc in pkgsrc and split the viewer
  and server.  Remove the viewer from this package and either move
  wip/vncviewer4 to wip/realvncviewer or move this package from
  wip/realvnc to wip/vnc4.  I prefer keeping the realvnc name.

- Still havn't looked into IPv6 support.
