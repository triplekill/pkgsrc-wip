 * Check portability of patches/patch-ae: The assumption is that pkgsrc always
   sets the qmake mkspec to "netbsd-g++", regardless of the host OS. The ld
   library is part of the libc on BSD, but has to be specified on other systems
   like linux. QMake and pkgsrc should set "-lld" directly for those systems.
 * Check portability of the 'find -exec' command used to install dirs and data.
 * Optional Debugging Helper (gdb output beautification for Qt objects) that
   is compiled through qtcreator itself does not yet work without manual
   modification. A fix is underway.
