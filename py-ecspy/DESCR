ECsPy (Evolutionary Computations in Python) is a free, open source framework
for creating evolutionary computations in Python. Additionally, ECsPy provides
an easy-to-use canonical genetic algorithm (GA), evolution strategy (ES),
estimation of distribution algorithm (EDA), differential evolution algorithm
(DEA), and particle swarm optimizer (PSO) for users who don't need much
customization
