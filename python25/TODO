* Darwin, HP/UX [... others?]  Darwin now has dlopen() support ... see docs.
* I don't know which modules should be disabled, but there are new ones.
Please audit this list.
* pkgsrc framework
* PLISTs

* The setup.py script rejects db4 versions older than 4.6 by default
   since Python-2.5.2, because older are said to be "buggy".
   We have patched away the check in patch-am, but maybe we need to revisit it?

* IN.py is no longer installed, why?

* db 1.85 handling seems to do the wrong thing, PLIST problem(?)

* make it not install "egg files" when installing 3rdparty python modules

* before we import it to pkgsrc, someone should run the test suite
