SuperTux is a classic 2D jump'n run sidescroller game in a style similar to the
original SuperMario games.

The Milestone1 release of SuperTux features 9 enemies, 26 playable levels,
software and OpenGL rendering modes, configurable joystick and keyboard input,
new music and completly redone graphics. Together with a little story, we hope
to provide a good gaming experince with this first Milestone release.
