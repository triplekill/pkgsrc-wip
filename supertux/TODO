This package is mostly ready for "production".

Problems are listed as follows:
* XFree86 4.4.0 (tested: NetBSD/i386 2.0.2) dies frequently, when game is used
  in fullscreen mode, at least when using wide-screen resolutions.
** this does not happen any longer using XFree86 4.5.0 (in the tests did);
   different wide-screen handling in 4.5.0?
** package configured for fullscreen mode to be disabled by default
