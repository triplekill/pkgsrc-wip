This package is not ready for "production".

Problems are listed as follows:
* XFree86 4.4.0 (tested: NetBSD/i386 2.0.2) dies frequently, when game is used 
  in fullscreen mode, at least when using wide-screen resolutions.
  - fullscreen mode is (as workaround) disabled by default
* Sound/Music cannot be used because the game claims to not found a file.
 - starting the game works using the --disable-sound parameter, it dumps core
   otherwise
