things to fix:

	- make install still installs in /usr/local !

	- I've got a little trouble with PKGNAME that can't be equal to DISTNAME
	  as it finishes with .pre3.  I'm using PKGNAME=postoffice-1.3 as a hack for now.

	- make /usr/pkg/etc/rc.d/postoffice
	- make /usr/pkg/share/examples/postoffice/mailer.conf
	- make /usr/pkg/etc/postoffice.cf that equals to 
	  /usr/pkg/share/examples/postoffice/postoffice.cf

	- create /etc/virtual and /var/spool/virtual if POSTOFFICE_VIRTUAL=YES

	- probably other things
