"Postoffice is a simple SMTP mail server and client. I wrote it for pell because
spam was getting out of control and I would rather write my own mail service
than continue to hack up sendmail for antispammery. Postoffice provides a
greylist to slow down the rate of incoming spam, and can be configured to do
antivirus checking on incoming mail either via the sendmail milter protocol or a
traditional hardcoded AV program. (the copy on Pell is configured to call the
ClamAV antivirus program to [slowly] detect and reject viruses.)

Postoffice can be configured to deliver mail to accounts inside vm-pop3d-style
virtual domains, and it can further be enabled to support AUTH LOGIN for people
inside virtual domains, so they can use postoffice as a mail forwarder when
replying to mail (I've also written some virtual domain utility programs to go
along with the virtual domain code in postoffice and vm-pop3d.)

Postoffice accepts (and ignores) many of the same command line options that are
passed to sendmail, and it comes with the usual crop of sendmail compatable
aliases; runq, mailq, newaliases, and sendmail."
