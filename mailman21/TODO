$NetBSD$

This is a new package of the mailman 2.1.x tree. mailman 2.0.x is already in
pkgsrc.  The only thing I'd like to clean up is the "${CHMOD} -R a+w ${WRKSRC}"
but I have to do this or else make clean won't work unless the user does an
su to root. I tried to capture the build uid so I could do a chown, which I'd
prefer, but I could not get it working.  If you can think of anything to get
round this pls email me.

PLEASE NOTE: The package it's self works file - this is just a build issue.

Tested on NetBSD 1.6 i386.

Regards,

Adrian.
