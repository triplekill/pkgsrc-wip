Goals:

  0) No gui :-)
  1) Packages user is interested in are registered in a special database,
     plain text file similar to pkg_chk.conf by pkgtools/pkg_chk
  2) Everything is made through pkg_summary.gz/.txt,
     see 7), 8)
  3) Cache directory for downloaded packages, no 'ftp ... | tar ...'
  4) No pkg_add -u|-uu. Package's versions should be analysed
     by pkgpm.
  5) pkg_check_summary - sanity checks for pkg_summary.txt,
     i.e. REQUIRES/PROVIDES consistency, versioned dependencies
     in DEPENDS etc.
  6) wip/pkg_summary-utils and wip/awk-pkgsrc-dewey are in use
  7) NetBSD's ftp://...pkg_summary.gz + pkg_summary.txt for locally built
     packages + user's preferences = final pkg_summary.txt
  8) User can have his preferences about what packages
     can be installed/upgraded
     from the remote repsitory and what packages cannot, see 2) and 7)
  9) shell + runawk + awk
  10) (optional) local pkg_src_summary.txt database
  11) Ability to remove old binaries from pkgsrc/packages,
      see pkg_src_summary and pkg_cmp_summary.
      Ability to remove old source tarball from pkgsrc/distfiles,
      see pkg_src_summary and pkg_cmp_summary.

pkgpm options:

1) install packages
2) registered packages

  -r +epkgpath      - add package to 2)
  -r -epkgpath      - add package from 2)
  -ra               - add all installed packages to 2)
  -rc               - register all installed packages in 2)
                      and remove all others

  -cir              - compare installed vs. registered
  -cib              - compare installed vs. binary pkg_summary.gz
  -cio              - compare installed vs. pkg_online database
  -cis              - compare installed vs. pkgsrc source tree
  -ciS              - compare installed vs. pkg_src_summary.txt

  -crs              - compare installed registered vs. pkgsrc source tree
  -crS              - compare installed registered vs. pkg_src_summary.txt

  -cbS              - compare binary vs. pkg_src_summary.txt

  -ib               - install missed packages through binary pkg_summary.gz
  -is               - install missed packages through pkgsrc tree

  -uba              - upgrade package through binary pkg_summary.gz
  -usa              - upgrade package through pkgsrc tree
