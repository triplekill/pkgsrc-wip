The Ada compiler front-end of gcc is itself written
in Ada. Consequently, an Ada compiler must be used
to build this pkg. In pkgsrc, lang/gcc3-ada is version
3.3 of the gcc Ada compiler; it also requires an Ada
compiler to build. This pkg may also be built from an
installed copy of itself.

For bootstrapping, you can download a pre-built version
of this package from:

A pre-built gcc3-ada may be downloaded from:

https://www.johnrshannon.com/NetBSD/ix86/gcc3-ada.tgz

Both pkgs were built on NetBSD 1.6ZK for Intel ix86 hardware.
