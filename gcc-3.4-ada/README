In order to build this Ada compiler, you need
a working GNAT compiler (GNAT version 3.14 or
later, or GCC version 3.1 or later), including
GNAT tools such as gnatmake and gnatlink, since
the Ada front end is written in Ada.

pkgsrc/lang/gcc3-ada will work as will this pkg

To build:

1. Change ADA_BOOT_PATH in the pkg Makefile
   to the directory for you Ada compiler.
2. Make sure ${ADA_BOOT_PATH}/bin is on your
   search path and GCC_EXEC_PREFIX is defined
   as the directory in which 'gnat1' is found.
3. If your gcc compiler front-end that understands
   Ada is named something other than gcc, define
   the environment variable ADA_BOOT_ADAC as the 
   full path of your gcc compiler front-end.
4. make
5. (OPTIONAL) Make test. This step requires
   dejagnu. As part of test, acats, the Ada
   compiler validation suite is run.
6. make install


NOTES:
1. This pkg can buid itself. You can run
   make && make update to rebuild it.
2. On NetBSD systems with native pthreads, you
   will have a full implementation of the Ada
   language. On other platforms, you will not
   have a tasking runtime.
