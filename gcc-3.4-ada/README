The Ada compiler front-end of gcc is itself written
in Ada. Consequently, an Ada compiler must be used
to build this pkg. In pkgsrc, lang/gcc3-ada is version
3.3 of the gcc Ada compiler; it also requires an Ada
compiler to build. This pkg may also be built using
wip/gcc-3.4.0 (which contains Ada).

You can download a pre-built version this package
(suitable for bootstrapping wip/gcc-3.4.0) from: 

https://www.johnrshannon.com/NetBSD/ix86/gccAda-3.4.0.tgz
https://www.johnrshannon.com/NetBSD/pentium4/gccAda-3.4.0.tgz

Both pkgs were built on NetBSD 2.0C.

Full Ada language support is provided for:
  Intel Ix86 on NetBSD with native pthread support
  AMD 64 on NetBSD with native pthread support
