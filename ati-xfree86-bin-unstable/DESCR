This package installs the latest AMD/ATI Linux binary driver(s) in
a manner suitable for use on NetBSD/i386 with XFree86 4.3 and above.
This driver provides dual-head support (with or without Xinerama).
This package does not enable accelerated GL support, nor DRI.

This driver is the latest driver as released by AMD/ATI, but is not
as well tested and hence may be less stable.
