pandas provides NumPy-based data structures and statistical tools for
common time series and cross-sectional data sets. It is intended to
accomplish the following:

* Simplify working with possibly labeled 1, 2, and 3 dimensional
  heterogeneous data sets commonly found in statistics, finance, and
  econometrics.

* Provide IO utilities for getting data in and out of pandas

* Implement common statistical models with a convenient interface,
  handling missing data and other common problems associated with
  messy statistical data sets
