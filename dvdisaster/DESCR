dvdisaster:

* creates error correction data to compensate read errors which are not
  correctable in the CD/DVD drive.
* tries to read as much data as possible from defective
  media. Afterwards unreadable sectors are recovered using the previously
  created error correction data.
* operates at the image level and does not depend on the file system.
