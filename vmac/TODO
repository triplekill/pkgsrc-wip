- The Gemuator ROM Board doesn't supported yet on all platforms
  due to missing libc5 or glibc (both have an ioperm() and some
  other functions called from Gemulator_LoadROM() in gemulator.c).
  Moreover, on some systems it's not really needed.  I feel the
  #if directives (in patch-aa) should be exacted.
