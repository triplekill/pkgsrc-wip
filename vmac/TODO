- The vmac.1.gz file just a preformatted plain text, not a roff(1)
  source. Thus, it installed into man/man1 as vmac.0, not vmac.1,
  so as call manpage from latter one causes to overprocessing by
  roff.

- The Gemuator ROM Board doesn't supported yet on all platforms
  due to missing libc5 or glibc (both have an ioperm() and some
  other functions called from Gemulator_LoadROM() in gemulator.c).
  Moreover, on some systems it's not really needed.  I feel the
  #if directives (in patch-aa) should be exacted.

- Remove dependency on Motif GUI or import it as vmac-motifgui.
