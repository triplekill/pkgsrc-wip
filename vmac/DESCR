vMac is a multiplatform Macintosh emulator that currently emulates
a Motorola 68000 based Apple Macintosh Plus.

Currently System 7.5.5 is the latest vMac can boot, which is the
latest System a real MacPlus can boot. vMac runs in black an white,
a larger screen and color is the next thing authors are working on.

On some systems (at least NetBSD) it lacks support of Gemulator
ROM board (yet).
