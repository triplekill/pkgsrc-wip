Reinteract is a system for interactive experimentation with Python
Reinteract worksheets contain Python code combined with the results
of that code, formatted as text or graphical plots. Unlike a traditional shell
you can go back and edit previously entered statements, and the results will
update. Among other things, Reinteract is suitable for experimentation with
the Python language and for data analysis using the NumPy and SciPy packages
