Firefox 2 Release Candidate 3 (RC 3) is a preview release of our next
generation Firefox browser and is being made available for download to Web
application developers, our testing community and users who want to get a
sneak peek at the next version of Firefox. Please note that at this time,
users should not expect all of their extensions, plugins and themes from
previous versions of Firefox to work properly.
