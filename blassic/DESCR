Blassic is a classic Basic interpreter. The line numbers
are mandatory, and it has PEEK & POKE.
The main goal is to execute programs written in oldd
interpreters, even those that use peculiar control
flow constructs or automodifiable code. However,
it can be used as a scripting language,
and has some not-so-classic instructions. It has
graphics modes that are compatible with some classic
systems and user defined.
