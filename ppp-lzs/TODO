Use pkglint and fix the problems listed.

Also:

- The DESCRiption says "In order to compile this, you will need to have
the source sets installed." pkgsrc is for many operating systems.
So mention this needs "NetBSD source sets".

- Use ONLY_FOR_PLATFORM=        NetBSD-*-*

- MESSAGE should be resaved as MESSAGE.NetBSD (but that doesn't really
matter if ONLY_FOR_PLATFORM is only NetBSD) because the MESSAGE is
operating system specific.

- The MAINTAINER line must be changed. I'd suggest you use your email
address.

- DESCRiption says "I wrote" and "I don't" but doesn't tell us who "I" is.
Maybe rewrite DESCRiption to just explain what the package is.
