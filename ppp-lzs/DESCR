This is a NetBSD decompressor for PPP compatible with the Stac LZS
scheme as described in rfc1974.  The algorithm is apparently covered
by patents held by Hifn in the USA and Europe though I wrote this
code independently with no help from Hifn or anybody associated with
them, and I dont know the details of the patents.  You might want
to consider this 'example' code only if that makes you feel better.

In order to compile this, you will need to have the source sets
installed.
