(1) Only tried with NetBSD/amd64, just starting. (Thanks @tsutsuii)
   - Test is only done by FreeWnn, but not successfull even with it 
     (you need to start jserver before you start mule)

(2) src/xemacs is not handled yet

(3) mule-init.el is not honored due to wrong PATH configuration

(4) in some case you will see
modena@makoto 13:51:14/150407(..wip/mule11)% mule
Fatal error (6).zsh: abort (core dumped)  mule

(4-2) *** I M P O R T A N T    F O R   N O W  ***

If you check your available font, like
  xlsfonts |& grep jis
and take one of them, say,
  mule -fn "-sony-fixed-medium-r-normal--16-120-100-100-c-80-jisx0201.1976-0"
or
  mule -fn "-misc-fixed-medium-r-normal--14-130-75-75-c-70-jisx0201.1976-0"

  otherwise, you will see next items.
