The goal of the DateTime Project is to produce a suite of
inter-operable modules for dealing with dates and times. The suite
includes modules in the following categories:

    * A base DateTime object, possibly with multiple implementations.
      This object represents the Gregorian in calendar in use today.
    * A set of modules for dealing with today's complex time zone
      system. These modules work together with the base DateTime
      object to handle the complexities of dealing with the local
      times.
    * Parsing and formatting datetimes.
    * Classes to represent other calendars that are, or have been,
      used around the world such as the Hebrew calendar, the Chinese
      calendar, and so on.
    * Classes for things like sets of datetimes, datetime spans, and
      so on. These things are quite important when doing calendaring
      or scheduling, to name a couple applications of these concepts.
    * Modules to do special purpose tasks, such as calculating the
      date upon which Easter falls in a given year.
