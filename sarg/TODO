- Update to sarg-2.1 (some patches against 1.4.1 were provided by
  Ben Collver in tech-pkg@)

- Month sorting was temporary disabled (because not supported by
  my NetBSD-current sort(1) at prime time).

- SARG doesn't sort index entries correctly in case if date format
  is an European. This is completely SARG issue (see index.c file
  for details - it insufficiently uses external sort(1) utility).
