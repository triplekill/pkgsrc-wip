*** Changes in avr-libc-1.8.0:

* Bugs fixed:

  [#17815] Configure does not honor --mandir option
  [#23234] Alternate interrupt macro
  [#24861] Interrupt documentation contains extra include
  [#32103] Support for Target-Triplets
  [#32419] Incorrect EEPROM size in header for ATxmega192A3
  [#32650] Missing include in util/delay.h
  [#32675] power_all_enable/disable does not affect timer1 on ATmega164P
  [#32698] power.h has additional endif that will break the build
  [#32773] stdiodemo source code is broken
  [#32988] Internal compiler error: build_unary_op
  [#33130] twitest.c source code is broken
  [#33230] Sleep modes have incorrect names for ATtiny261/461/861
  [#33238] Wrong _VECTORS_SIZE for mega8U2 et al
  [#33858] in avr/power.h, clock_prescale_set() not defined for mega328
  [#33920] ICR1 incorrectly defined for tiny167
  [#34047] missing math.h include in delay.h
  [#34514] misspelled in math.h
  [#35020] stdint.h: signed types need explicit "signed"
  [#35093] strlcat_P fails for some destinations
  [no-id]  New names for CLKSTA/CLKSEL0/1 for AT90USB82/162
  system when power_all_disable() is used
  [no-id]  util/delay.h would not compile with -ffreestanding

* New devices supported:

* Contributed Patches:

  [#7531] Bad name of bit in TCCR0A : WGM0 instead of CTC0 for ATtinyX61
  [#7362] iom16a.h: USART vectors inconsistently named for ATmega16A
  [#7226] ATMEGA8U2 Patches

* Other changes:

  - The old prog_* typedefs are now deprecated, and are only included
  if requested by the user.  This request is expressed by declaring
  the macro __PROG_TYPES_COMPAT__, either by a #define directive
  before including <avr/pgmspace.h>, or by a -D compiler option.

  - Optimized strlen_P, thanks to Jan Waclawek. Rename strlen_P to be
  __strlen_P and add new strlen_P inline function in header file that
  checks if value is a constant and known at compile time. If not,
  then the new inline function calls __strlen_P as normal.

*** Changes in avr-libc-1.7.1:
* Bugs fixed:   (7 line)

* New devices supported:

  ATTiny84a
  ATMega16HVB RevB
  ATMega32HVB RevB

*** Changes in avr-libc-1.7.0:

* Bugs fixed: ( 138 line)

* Other changes:

  - Added 'avr35' architecture.
  - Function vfscanf() is rewriten. 
  - EEPROM functions are rewriten.  
  - Added support for XMEGA architectures.
  - The Postscript documentation build has been removed in favour of
    building only the PDF (and HTML and man page) versions. 
  - A sleeping BOD API was added to <avr/sleep.h>. 
  - The note about signbit() implementation is removed from documenatation.
  - Signature API added in <avr/signature.h>.
  - All functions are now placed in the .text.avr-libc section, and the 
    floating point functions are placed in the .text.avr-libc.fplib section.
  - The port/pin assignments of the HD44780 LCD controller in the
    stdiodemo example can now be distributed across more than a single
    AVR port. 
  - Added support for avrtiny10 architecture, to support the ATtiny10 Family.
  - Added new headerfile: <avr/cpufunc.h>; currently contains _NOP() and
    _MemoryBarrier().
  - The twidemo can now optionally address 24C32 and larger EEPROMs
    that require 16-bit word addressing.
  - Add a "memory barrier" to the cli() and sei() macros.
