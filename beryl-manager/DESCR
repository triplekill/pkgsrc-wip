       beryl-manager is a tray application that allows you  to  launch  beryl,
       start  different window decorators, start a different window manager or
       launch beryl-settings to configure your beryl environment. Should beryl
       crash,  the  beryl-manager  will try to launch a window manager to fall
       back to.
