- Pkglint finds that I hardcoded /var/log/... as the log directory.
  If there is a way for pkgsrc to know your favorite log location,
  I don't know what it is.

- To install rc.d scripts, use the RCD_SCRIPTS feature provided by
  bsd.pkg.install.mk (USE_PKGINSTALL=YES).  Unfortunately, the former
  is not documented in Packages.txt yet (there is an open PR about it)
  but you may want to look at some other packages to see how the thing
  works (see security/racoon or net/samba for example).

  In a nutshell, rename the script to <rcdname>.sh in the files dir
  and set RCD_SCRIPTS variable to rcdname, together with
  USE_PKGINSTALL=YES.

- Do not use MKDIR; and the way you are using it is completely wrong,
  as the directory is outside pkgsrc's tree.  Use OWN_DIRS instead,
  also part of bsd.pkg.install.mk (see cups for an example).

- Do not put example files under prefix/etc.  Use PKG_SYSCONFDIR
  instead (also part of bsd.pkg.install.mk). See section 10.27 of
  Packages.txt.

- ptl2 has a buildlink2 file, so use it instead of depends.  Or even
  better, use pthread.buildlink2.mk, located in mk/.

- For PKGNAME, do: PKGNAME= ${DISTNAME:S/-src//}

- WRKSRC is unsorted.  It goes after PKGNAME.

- MAKE_FLAGS should be separated from USE_* variables. (I don't think
  this matters much, but I prefer it this way ;)

- About MESSAGE... see pkglint:

  WARN: ./MESSAGE should begin with a 75-character double-dashed line.
  FATAL: missing RCS Id in MESSAGE file: ./MESSAGE
  WARN: ./MESSAGE should end with a 75-character double-dashed line.

- Add a trailing / to HOMEPAGE.
