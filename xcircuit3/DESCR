XCircuit is a UNIX/X11 program for drawing publishable-quality
electrical circuit schematic diagrams and related figures, and
produce circuit netlists through schematic capture. XCircuit regards
circuits as inherently hierarchical, and writes both hierarchical
PostScript output and hierarchical SPICE netlists. Circuit components
are saved in and retrieved from libraries which are fully editable.

XCircuit does not separate artistic expression from circuit drawing;
it maintains flexiblity in style without compromising the power of
schematic capture. The XCircuit is useful for creation of many and
many things from electric circuits to misic sheets, house plans,
and even to logotypes.
