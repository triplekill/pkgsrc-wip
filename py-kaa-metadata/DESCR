The Kaa Media Repository is a set of python modules related to media.

Kaa provides a base module that implements the common features needed for
application development, such as mainloop management, timers, signals,
callbacks, file descriptor monitors, etc. Kaa's other modules provide specific
media-related functionality, such as retrieving metadata on arbitrary media
files (kaa.metadata, previously called mmpython), Python wrappers for Imlib2,
Xine, and Evas, and many other high level APIs for easily creating applications
that deal with video and audio.
