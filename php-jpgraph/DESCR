JpGraph is an OO class library for PHP (ver >=4.04) JpGraph makes it easy to
draw both "quick and dirty" graphs with a minimum of code and complex
professional looking graphs which requires a very fine grain of control. The
library assigns context sensitive default values for most parameters which
helps minimize the learning curve.

The only requirement is that the PHP installation needs to have the GD
library setup correctly (most PHP installations do).
