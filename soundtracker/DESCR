SoundTracker is a music tracking tool for Unix / X11 similar in design to
the DOS program FastTracker and the Amiga legend ProTracker. 

Samples can be lined up on tracks and patterns which are then arranged to a
song. Supported module formats are XM and MOD; the player code is the one
from OpenCP.

A basic sample recorder and editor is also included. SoundTracker is free
("open source") software, licensed under the GNU GPL.
