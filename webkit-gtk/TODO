o I have just updated the patches and tryed to build it solving various
  issues during the build process.
  At the moment it is intended only for MAINTAINERs (e.g. PLIST is not
  updated nor I succesfully built it at the moment).
o Change the GCC_REQD replacing with ONLY_FOR_COMPILER or similar if it is
  possible.
