Io is small prototype-based programming language. The ideas in Io are mostly
inspired by Smalltalk (all values are objects), Self, NewtonScript and Act1
(prototype-based differential inheritance, actors and futures for concurrency),
LISP (code is a runtime inspectable/modifiable tree) and Lua (small, embeddable)
