- get the 2 p5 dependencies in pkgsrc updated to required versions
- find out how to let pkgsrc create a group without a user (I don't
  remember what the problem was, only that there was one)
- group the DEPENDS lines by their reason (postgres, apache, core, ...)
- split the Makefile in a Makefile.common, to allow the creation
  of a mysql package
- more testing
