$NetBSD$

Add the following line to httpd.conf to make Moodle accessible
through your HTTP server:

	Include ${PKG_SYSCONFDIR}/moodle.conf

Your Moodle is then accessible through:

	http://www.example.com/moodle/

Then create a user and a database for Moodle to store all
its tables in (or choose an existing database).

For more information, see the INSTALL DOCUMENTATION:
