giFTui is a graphical user interface to giFT using GTK+2.

giFTui was designed to be easily usable, somehow using the same logic 
as other well-known peer-2-peer clients.

It's features are :

  * multiple browse user and search tabs
  * status tab (gives you information about the network(s))
  * transfer tab (gives you info about... your transfers !!)
  * configure tab (enables you to configure giFTui as well as giFT and 
    its protocols)
