MD5 user authentication currently duesn't work on NetBSD
because libmhash.so (security/mhash) pollutes the libc namespace which breaks
crypt(3).

You can fix this by applying mhash.diff to pkgsrc/security/mhash/Makefile
and reinstalling it.

The imap server sometimes gets wedged due to some libevent issue.
Causing random file descriptor activity is enough to unwedge it.
I keep a script running in the background for now:

#! /bin/sh
while :; do
(while :; do echo A1 CAPABILITY; sleep 1; done) | nc localhost 143
sleep 1
done
