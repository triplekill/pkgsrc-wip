Current music players are focused on managing your music collection, while using
mandatory criteria about how they organize it.

Eina does not care about it at all. If you are an organized person, chances are
your music collection is organized too, and you won't like to spend your time
rearranging it to follow your player's specific rules. In addition, having those
players to arrange music that's randomly stored, named or tagged, is usually
counterproductive.
