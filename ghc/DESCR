GHC: The Glasgow Haskell Compiler.

The Glasgow Haskell Compiler is a robust, fully-featured, optimising
compiler for the functional programming language Haskell 98
(http://www.haskell.org). GHC compiles Haskell to either native code
or C. It implements numerous experimental language extensions to
Haskell, including concurrency, a foreign language interface, several
type-system extensions, exceptions, and so on. GHC comes with a
generational garbage collector, a space and time profiler, and a
comprehensive set of libraries.

This package uses binary bootstrap kits.  At least some of them are
not created by people who have signed the NetBSD developer agreement,
and therefore this package cannot be moved into pkgsrc proper.
