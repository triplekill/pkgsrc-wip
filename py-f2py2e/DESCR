The purpose of the F2PY --Fortran to Python interface generator-- project is
to provide connection between Python and Fortran languages. F2PY is a Python
extension tool for creating Python C/API modules from (handwritten or F2PY
generated) signature files (or directly from Fortran sources). The generated
extension modules facilitate:

* Calling Fortran 77/90/95, Fortran 90/95 module, and C functions from Python.
* Accessing Fortran 77 COMMON blocks and Fortran 90/95 module data (including
  allocatable arrays) from Python.
* Calling Python functions from Fortran or C (call-backs).
* Automatically handling the difference in the data storage order of
  multi-dimensional Fortran and Numerical Python (i.e. C) arrays.
