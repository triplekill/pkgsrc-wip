make (GNU make utility to maintain groups of programs)

This is the GNU implementation of make, which was written by Richard
Stallman and Roland McGrath.  The purpose of the make utility is to
determine automatically which pieces of a large program need to be 
recompiled, and issue the commands to recompile them.  

This is needed to compile just about any major C program, including
the Linux kernel.
