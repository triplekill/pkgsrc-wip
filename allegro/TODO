Reason it's not committed:
liquidwar isn't working, probably a threading issue. (LW now works for me in
current, aside from sound. My 1.6.1 machine is too slow to do any real testing,
but it loads, and I get some water noises -Soren)

Sound doesn't work for me in current, but works fine on 1.6.1. Still
investigating this. (Soren)

patch-aa, patch-ab, and patch-ad are only there to add debug flags --
they should be removed once the problem with liquid war is found and fixed.
The same holds for --enable-dbglib in Makefile.

patch-ae is an unsuccessful try to fix the problem.

Help in debugging this welcome.
