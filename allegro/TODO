Reason it's not committed:
liquidwar isn't working, probably a threading issue. (LW's menu loads in 1.6.1
if I wait a while, and works flawlessly in current -Soren)

patch-aa, patch-ab, and patch-ad are only there to add debug flags --
they should be removed once the problem with liquid war is found and fixed.
The same holds for --enable-dbglib in Makefile.

patch-ae is an unsuccessful try to fix the problem.

Help in debugging this welcome.
