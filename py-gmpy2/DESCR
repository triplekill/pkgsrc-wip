gmpy2 is a C-coded Python extension module that supports multiple-precision
arithmetic. gmpy2 is the successor to the original gmpy module. The gmpy module
only supported the GMP multiple-precision library. gmpy2 adds support for the
MPFR (correctly rounded real floating-point arithmetic) and MPC (correctly
rounded complex floating-point arithmetic) libraries. gmpy2 also updates the
API and naming conventions to be more consistent and support the additional
functionality
