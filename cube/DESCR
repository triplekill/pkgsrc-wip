Cube is an open source multiplayer and singleplayer first person shooter
game built on an entirely new and very unconventional engine. Cube is
a landscape-style engine that pretends to be an indoor FPS engine, which
combines very high precision dynamic occlusion culling with a form of
geometric mipmapping on the whole world for dynamic LOD for configurable
fps & graphic detail on most machines. Uses OpenGL & SDL.

Allows in-engine editing of geometry in full 3D (you fly around the map,
point / drag stuff to select it / modify it), which can even be done
simultaneously with others in multiplayer (a first!). Has simplistic but
effective fine grain vertex lighting that looks like lightmapping and can
do dynamic lights & shadows. Doesn't need any kind of map precompilation,
even lighting is done on the fly. Has very simplistic quad-tree world
structure that can do slopes (heightfields with caps) and slants, water,
does decent collision detection & physics, has client/server networking that
goes a long way in giving a lag-free game experience, and features a
Doom/Quake-style singleplayer (2 game modes, savegames) and multiplayer
(12 game modes, master server / server browser, demo recording) game with
some uncompromising brutal oldskool gameplay.
