Currently failing on startup with:
	Shared object "nss_dns.so.0" not found

I've chased this down to this email thread:
	http://searchirc.com/boards/viewtopic.php?p=29382&sid=fa5342126d1e97ce2e94b088d3f2afcd

Which basically means you have to install this:
	http://www.rsu.ru/~bushman/lookupd/

And then symlink:
	ln -s ${PREFIX}/lib/lkpd_dns.so.1 ${PREFIX}/lib/nss_dns.so.1

Which is great, except that lookupd is only for FreeBSD>5.1

Update:  If you remove /etc/nsswitch.conf that works as well.
