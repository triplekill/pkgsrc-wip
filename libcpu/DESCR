"libcpu" is an open source library that emulates several CPU architectures,
allowing itself to be used as the CPU core for different kinds of emulator
projects. It uses its own frontends for the different CPU types, and uses LLVM
for the backend. libcpu is supposed to be able to do user mode and system
emulation, and dynamic as well as static recompilation.
