fix the fetching of mercrain. the trailing .zip needs to be removed in
order to fetch properly. I can't think of a sane way to do this.

post-install should just use cpio ??
but cpio may not exist? and no CPIO is defined

sometimes crashes at startup with:
. World Initialisation ...
speedx in free(): warning: junk pointer, too high to make sense.
Error (Bad Attached memory shared)

should have oss option

getopt (or whatever) is broken
speedx --help # doesn't work, but -h says it does

I am still trying to find out license for that sound file download

test over network
