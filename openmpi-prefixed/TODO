Figure out why MPI progs are so verbose.

Install openmpi/etc/openmpi-default-hostfile if not present
 - What happens if build system is different from deployment system?

Install module system such as lmod
	Generate env setup script and modulefile and install to
	${PREFIX}/share or ${PREFIX}/etc
 - Install to $(PKG_SYSCONFDIR) rather?
