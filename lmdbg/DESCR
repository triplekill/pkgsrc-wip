LMDBG is a collection of small tools for collecting and analysing the
logs of malloc/realloc/memalign/free function calls. Unlike many
others LMDBG does *NOT* provide any way to detect overruns of the
boundaries of a malloc() memory allocations. On the other hand LMDBG
provides sory leaks effectively excluding those appeared in system
libraries (e.g. libc).ome features that others doesn't have.  LMDBG
provides a FULL stacktrace of each malloc/realloc/memalign/free call.
Your application should *NOT* be (re)linked statically to be checked
by LMDBG.  LMDBG correctly determines source.c:NNN even if it is in
the shared library.  LMDBG is portable to many OSes and doesn't make
your application significantly slower. LMDBG allows to effectively
exclude memory leaks appeared in system libraries, e.g. in libc.

               LMDBG - lightweight malloc debugger.

LMDBG logs the calls of malloc/realloc/free/memalign functions with their
stack frames and analyses such a logs.

lmdbg-run  - for create malloc/realloc/free/memalign logs
lmdbg-sym  - for converting address to 'file.c:NUM func_name'
lmdbg-leak - memory leaks checker
