I'd prefer to use buildink2 for this but libevent and libdnet don't
support it yet :(

The name of the program also needs to be resolved as there is already an
arpd package in pkgsrc.  I've emailed the author of this software a few
times now but have not received a response.  Consider this name
temporary.

For some reason I can't get the startup script to install properly.  If
you can see where I'm stuffing up pls email me.

Please test and let me know if there are any other issues.

Tested on NetBSD 1.6 i386.

Ta,

Adrian.
