Should we split up the plugins into audacious-arts, audacious-esd etc
or keep/extend the PKG_OPTIONS?

gdt: the plugins should be split into separate packages.  It's
certainly ok to include a lot of basic plugins in a single package if
they don't have 'unreasonable' dependencies, meaning dependencies that
a significant number of people won't want to install.

While PKG_OPTIONS is a nice mechanism, the problem in this context is
that binary packages are built using the default, and that either
omits useful plugins or requires too many dependencies, and split
packages enable binary builds from which many more people can install
what they want.
