1.11 "Apollo"
=============
   * Bug Fixes
        - Fix possibly wrong `input-focus' from `enter-*' focus-modes
          in tabbed-windowing. [fuchur]

        - Properly support tabbed-windowing when tiling is active
          aswell. [fuchur]

        - Several fixes for the `wallpaper' module regarding wrong
          values or non-existent files. [Christopher Bratusek]

        - When calling the `stop' function from `sawfish.wm.prg'
          fehlstart, trayer, pancake, xmobar and xsettingsd modules
          calling `start' afterwards in the same session failed. This
          is fixed now. [Christopher Bratusek]

        - When installing manpages the `mandir' from configure is now
          honoured. [Christopher Bratusek]

        - Fix handling symbol-type defcustoms in sawfish-xgettext,
          preventing generation of new sawfish.pot. [Christopher
          Bratusek]

        - Fixed that `Open Home' was shown in the root menu even if
          `filemanager-program' was unset. [Christopher Bratusek]

        - In SawfishConfig `x-terminal-emulator' was used to access the
          Sawfish info-file. For better compat with
          non-Debian-distributions, use `xterm' instead. Note that the
          Sawfish variable `xterm-program' is not accessible from
          SawfishConfig. [Christopher Bratusek]

   * New Features
        - Session scripts with xdm (and compatible) integration.
          [fuchur] [Christopher Bratusek]
             x `sawfish-mate-session'/`Sawfish/MATE' start Sawfish and
               then initialize MATE session.

             x `sawfish-kde4-session'/`Sawfish/KDE4' start Sawfish and
               then initialize KDE4 session. [note: it's still possible
               to select Sawfish from System Settings > Default
               Applications and starting KDE4 normally using Sawfish in
               favour of KWin]

             x `sawfish-xfce-session'/`Sawfish/XFCE' start Sawfish and
               then initialize XFCE session.

             x `sawfish-lumina-session'/`Sawfish/Lumina' start Sawfish
               and then initialize Lumina session. Also add Lumina
               integration module.

             x Other desktop environments:
                  + GNOME2: set the GConf key
                    `/desktop/gnome/session/required-components/windowmanager'
                    to `sawfish' and start a new session.

                  + LXDE: in lxsession-default-apps replace `openbox'
                    with `sawfish'.

                  + Razor Qt: in the razor configuration center >
                    default applications enter `sawfish' in the
                    corresponding field.

                  + Other: no other desktop environments are officially
                    supported as of now.

             x Note for Debian users: the official Sawfish Debian
               GNU/Linux packages for amd64/i386/armhf distributed at
               http://apt.nanolx.org/ now have three more packages
               built from the Sawfish source:
                  + `sawfish-kde4-session': install above mentioned
                    KDE4 integration and (install if not already)
                    kde-core (metapackage for minimal KDE4 desktop)

                  + `sawfish-mate-session': install above mentioned
                    MATE integration and (install if not already)
                    mate-desktop-environment-core (metapackage for
                    minimal MATE desktop)

                  + `sawfish-xfce-session': install above mentioned
                    XFCE integration and (install if not already) xfce
                    (meta-package for XFCE desktop)

                  + `sawfish-lumina-session': install above mentioned
                    Lumina integration and (install if not already)
                    lumina-desktop (meta-package for Lumina Desktop)

        - `CTWM' like interactive window placement. Previously pressing
          any button while interactively placing a window would place
          it. `Sawfish' now mimics `CTWM's behaviour: pressing button 1
          will just place the window, button 2 will allow dragging to
          resize the window and place it when the button releases,
          button 3 will place the window and attempt to fill it to the
          screen bottom. [Maxime Soul√©]

        - New EdgeActions for when moving windows. [Christopher
          Bratusek]
             x `kill' Kill a window when moved to the given edge

             x `iconify' Iconify a window when moved to the given edge

             x `move-window-viewport' Move window to the viewport in
               the direction of moving against the edge

             x `move-window-workspace' Move window to the workspace in
               the direction of moving against the edge

        - Separate left/right and top/bottom edges in SawfishConfig,
          allowing for individual actions on each edge. [Christopher
          Bratusek]

        - Add `send-window-to-next-head' and
          `send-window-to-previous-head' functions for moving windows
          across heads. [fuchur]

        - Add `toggle-window-fixed-size' for toggling fixed-size on
          windows, also used in lock-button `Button3-Off'. [fuchur]

        - Add ability to move tabs around in the titlebar. [fuchur]

        - Add `run-application' by Sergey I. Sharybin, with several
          improvements and better integration into Sawfish. Also add
          'Run Application' entry at the bottom of the root menu.
          [Christopher Bratusek]

        - Add `sawfish.wm.prg.nm-applet', simple auto-starter for the
          `Network Manager Applet'. [Christopher Bratusek]

        - Add `sawfish.wm.prg.diodon', simple auto-starter for the
          `Diodon Clipboard Manager'. [Christopher Bratusek]

        - Add `sawfish.wm.prg.conky', simple auto-starter for the
          `Conky System Monitor', that allows for custom command line
          options to be passed. [Christopher Bratusek]

        - Add `sawfish.wm.prg.idesk', simple auto-starter for the
          `Idesk Desktop Icon Manager'. [Christopher Bratusek]

   * Miscellaneous Changes
        - Majorly improved start-up speed of StyleTab theme by locking
          the re-coloring of images until all configuration is loaded,
          so that re-coloring is only done once upon start. [fuchur]

        - In `sawfish.wm.prg.compton' delay compton start by 3 seconds
          to prevent heavy screen flickering. [fuchur]

        - Partially revert focus changes introduced in Sawfish 1.6.0
          [fuchur], auto-apply window-matchers for Plasma when KDE4 is
          detected running, for proper user experience. [Christopher
          Bratusek]

        - Improve `cabinet' window-switcher. Code-cleanup, bug fixes,
          blacklisting applications (mostly panels, pagers) and icon
          for missing window-icons. [fuchur]

        - Enable `shade-hover' and `auto-raise' in SawfishConfig,
          utilize them in tabbed-windowing. [fuchur]

        - Add `marked-cursor-shape' defcustom (used when marking
          windows for tabbing). [fuchur]

        - Improve icon size in StyleTab, add `Flat' style. Also improve
          speed and decrease memory usage by mirroring images [fuchur]

        - Use `menulibre' instead of `alacarte' in XFCE and MATE
          integration by default [fuchur]

        - Do not let `xfce-session' save the session (by adding `-f'
          flag in XFCE integration) [fuchur]

        - Add `Open Terminal' and `Open Browser' to the root menu (if
          `xterm-program' or `browser-program' are set) [Christopher
          Bratusek]

        - Rename `toggle-fixed-position' to
          `toggle-window-fixed-position' to match naming spec.
          [Christopher Bratusek]

        - Tweak default compton settings. [fuchur]

        - Improve doc strings in many modules [fuchur]

        - Add `html' target to man/Makefile, creating
          html-documentation [Christopher Bratusek]
