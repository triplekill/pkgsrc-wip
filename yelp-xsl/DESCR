gnome-doc-utils is a collection of documentation utilities for the Gnome
project.  Notably, it contains utilities for building documentation and
all auxiliary files in your source tree, and it contains the DocBook
XSLT stylesheets that were once distributed with Yelp.  Starting with
Gnome 2.8, Yelp will require gnome-doc-utils for the XSLT.
