SynCE for KDE aims at integrating your device into KDE, providing the
expected communication facilities. In particular, the SynCE for KDE
project permits you:

    * To browse the device file system in Konqueror, and to transfer
      files in both directions
    * To install CAB files directly to the device
    * To mirror the device screen on your PC desktop, being therefore
      able to use your main keyboard to control it, taking screenshots,
      etc.
    * To connect several devices at a time.
