GRUB 2 is in development stage and is still neither complete nor well
tested.  Anyways, just installing this package can do no harm.

To actually install GRUB 2 to disk, use grub2-install utility.  Do not do
it unless you understand what it actually does, for it may lead to loss of
data when used improperly.

Please visit the official web page of GRUB 2, for more information.  The
URL is <http://www.gnu.org/software/grub/grub.html>.

For now, there is not much documentation yet.  Please look at the GRUB
Wiki <http://grub.enbug.org> for testing procedures.

Using package emulators/qemu for testing GRUB 2 is a good idea, indeed.

Enjoy GRUB.  Your feedback is welcome.
