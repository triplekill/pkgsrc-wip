Note: Google Earth *requires* DRI accelerated 3D graphics.
Note: Quickly click "No" in the dialog window which asks if you want to
	switch to DirectX. Otherwise, the programme will crash on first
	start. Subsequent launches of GoogleEarth will have this same
	dialog window. However, waiting to click Yes/No will not cause it
	to crash.
