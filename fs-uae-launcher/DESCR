This is a fork of UAE, the Ubiquitous Amiga Emulator, with an emulation core
based on WinUAE. It attempts to bring many of the great features of WinUAE
to non-Windows platforms.

This package provides fs-uae-launcher and fs-uae-arcade, which as packages
overlap 99% and don't need to be separated.

For the actual emulator, see fs-uae-dev.
