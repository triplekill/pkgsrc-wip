This is a fork of UAE, the Ubiquitous Amiga Emulator, with an emulation core
based on WinUAE. It attempts to bring many of the great features of WinUAE
to non-Windows platforms.

FS-UAE focuses on emulating Amiga games using the accurate emulation
code from WinUAE. It also has features to emulate a high-end Amiga with
expansions.

Unique features for FS-UAE are support for online play on all supported
platforms and an on-screen GUI controllable with keyboard and gamepad
controllers.

To make full use of FS-UAE you will need access to an image of some version
of the Amiga Kickstart ROM (although UAE does include a ROM emulation which
may work with some old games). The Amiga Kickstart ROMs are copyrighted
material and may not be freely distributed (so don't ask me for a copy). If
you don't have an Amiga from which you can legally make a ROM image, a
selection of ROM images are available for purchase online from Cloanto
(publishers of the Amiga Forever distribution). See
