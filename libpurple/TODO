- How to use textproc/intltool instead of the intltool in the pidgin archive?
  This would automatically require p5-XML-Parser.
- During build on NetBSD 3.0:
    iconv: iconv_open(UTF-8, tis-620): Invalid argument
- buildlink3.mk is just the output from "createbuildlink", must be checked
  for correctness.
- options: look for existing options in mk/defaults/options.description
