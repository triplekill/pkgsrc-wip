gMFSK is a multimode HF terminal program. Despite the name, gMFSK
can send and receive many digital conversational modes typically
used by radio amateurs on HF. Supported modes are:
  * MFSK (MFSK16 and MFSK8)
  * RTTY
  * THROB (1, 2 and 4 throbs/sec)
  * PSK31 (BPSK and QPSK)
  * MT63
  * Feldhell

gMFSK's features include:

  * Point-and-click tuning of decoded signal
  * Right click over received text and automatically move data to the log
    window
  * Multimode waterfall display (waterfall, spectrum, scope)
  * Remote logging using SysV IPC. (Currently supported by Xlog)
  * Rig control using hamlib. This can be used to show real frequencies in
    waterfall or to control PTT.
  * Fixtext macros can include variables and output from any Unix command.
