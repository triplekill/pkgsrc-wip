==========================================================================

To use the 1.4 series server with current pkgsrc, you must perform some
changes in pkgsrc first:

o Update xf86-input-keyboard from 1.2.0 to 1.2.2.

  This is done by editing the DISTNAME line in
  x11/xf86-input-keyboard/Makefile
  Then go to x11/xf86-input-keyboard and run make fetch; make distinfo

o Add this line to x11/modular-xorg-server/buildlink3.mk:

.include "../../x11/pixman/buildlink3.mk"

o You should now be able to build wip/modular-xorg-server14,
  x11/xf86-input-keyboard, x11/xf86-input-mouse and x11/xf86-video-*
