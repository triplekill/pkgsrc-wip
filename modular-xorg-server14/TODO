There's a bug with pointer movement. The pointer tends to warp to the
left edge of the screen when text is scrolling in an application.
This is reproducable by e.g. generating continous rapidly scrolling
text in x11/mrxvt, or by scrolling in firefox with the pgup/pgdn buttons
while moving the pointer.  Probably related to doing evil things
(FP?) while in a signal handler.

Update:  I applied a patch by Matthieu Herrb to hw/xfree86/common/xf86Xinput.c.
It changes the code so it doesn't calloc() while getting input events.
This does not solve the problem, but it does seem to have mitigated it
somewhat.  Argh!
