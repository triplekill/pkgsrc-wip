There's a bug with pointer movement. The pointer tends to warp to the
left edge of the screen when text is scrolling in an application.
This is reproducable by e.g. generating continous rapidly scrolling
text in x11/mrxvt, or by scrolling in firefox with the pgup/pgdn buttons
while moving the pointer.
