xcb-proto provides the XML-XCB (X C bindings) protocol descriptions
that libxcb uses to generate the majority of its code and API.

This package provides an XML Schema defining the data format for
describing the X protocol and XML descriptions of the core X protocol
and many extensions.

This separation between the XCB transport layer and the automatically-
generated protocol layer also makes it far easier to write new
extensions. With the Xlib infrastructure, client-side support for
new extensions requires significant duplication of effort. With
XCB and the XML-XCB protocol descriptions, client-side support for
a new extension requires only an XML description of the extension,
and not a single line of code.
