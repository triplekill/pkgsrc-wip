$NetBSD$

There are no default system-wide configuration files for this package.

Examples of configuration files can be found in
${PREFIX}/share/examples/openbox/

Copy rc.xml and menu.xml to the desired location. This path must include a
directory named openbox. For example: /usr/pkg/etc/openbox. Then set the
environment variable XDG_CONFIG_DIRS in your shell's configuration files.
If /usr/pkg/etc/openbox is where you want the openbox configuration files
to go, then you would set XDG_CONFIG_DIRS to /usr/pkg/etc.

See http://www.freedesktop.org/standards/basedir-spec/basedir-spec-0.6.html
for more information.

If you are not concerned with system-wide configuration, install wip/obconf
and run it before you start openbox for the first time.
