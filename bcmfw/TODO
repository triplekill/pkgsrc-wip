I'm just waiting to see if I get a response from Broadcom about the
redistributability of the firmware files (though there are no limitations
mentioned in the bluez-firmware-1.2.tar.gz archive). I emailed them
on 18 Aug 2006 explaining the situation and saying that if they wished
to impose limits then they should speak up. If I get no negative response
by the end of August I will let it go through as is.
