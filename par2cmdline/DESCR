"par2cmdline" provides a tool to apply the data-recovery capability concepts
of RAID-like systems to the posting and recovery of files - usually multi-part
binary files posted to Usenet. It is an extension of the original PAR format,
in that it lifts several restrictions regarding filesizes. Additionally,
partially downloaded files are no longer entirely discarded, giving it more
effective protection with less recovery data.
