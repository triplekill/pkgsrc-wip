o Test if it actually works
o Fix issues with py-Tk: when it's installed, py-OpenGL
seems to detect it somehow and fails to build if Tcl isn't
buildlinked.

NOTE: I can't test it on my system, with the NVidia GLX
driver, because of pthreads issues, so I leave it here
for someone with more experience in Python module
packaging.
