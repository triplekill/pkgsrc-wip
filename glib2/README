Added patch for gdummyfile.c.
    gcc 4.6 does not like a variable named "in".

Disabled hack converting libiconv_open calls.
    Same issue arose in pkg-config.
    Is this hack obsolete?
    Does this have to do with PREFER_{NATIVE|PKGSRC}?

Tested on OS X Snow Leopard with Xcode GCC and GCC 4.6.
