The netkit-base package contains inetd and ping for Linux.

inetd is the internet "super-server". inetd listens for network
connections and transfers to the appropriate daemon.

Note that this version of inetd is not built with internal libwrap
(TCP Wrappers) support. The separate tcpd software can be used;
tcpd is available in the security/tcp_wrappers package.

ping is the standard network testing program. ping sends ICMP
ECHO_REQUEST packets to a host and determines its response time.

This package also includes assorted, sample network config files,
such hosts.allow, inetd.conf, resolv.conf, services, and many
others.

This is the version maintained by David A. Holland. It is derived
from old BSD code.
