The 1.0 release of django-registration represents a complete rewrite of
the previous codebase, and introduces several new features which greatly
enhance the customizability and extensibility of
django-registration. Whenever possible, changes were made in ways which
preserve backwards compatibility with previous releases, but some
changes to existing installations will still be required in order to
upgrade to 1.0. This document provides a summary of those changes, and
of the new features available in the 1.0 release.
