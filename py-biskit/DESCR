Biskit is a modular, object-oriented Python library for
structural bioinformatics research. It facilitates the manipulation
and analysis of macromolecular structures, protein complexes, and molecular
dynamics trajectories. For efficient number crunching, Biskit objects tightly
integrate with numpy. Biskit also offers a platform for the rapid integration of
external programs and new algorithms into complex workflows
Calculations are thus often delegated to establisheds
