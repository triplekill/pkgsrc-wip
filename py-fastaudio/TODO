fastaudio 0.1 seems to be very beta at the moment, at least looking at
soruces, but I need it to do my paid development, so I'm porting it to -wip
anyway. 

In reality, this package currently is tightly fastened to portaudio,
whole Makefile is an ugly hack, and so on, so on.

I'm in concatct with fastaudio author, so propably we could make the things
cleaner with fastaudio 0.2

Currently the package compiles, but doesn't work:

>>> import fastaudio
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "<stdin>", line 1, in ?
  ImportError: /usr/pkg/lib/python2p3/site-packages/fastaudio.so: Undefined
PLT symbol "PaHost_Init" (reloc type = 7, symnum = 159)
