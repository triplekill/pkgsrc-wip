1. Invoke 'adamem' to start up in Adam computer mode.

2. Invoke 'cvem' to start up in Colecovision mode.

3. ADAMEm requires you to have several data files in your current
directory in order to run.  All the necessary files have been installed to
${PREFIX}/share/adamem. You should write a script that either changes
into that directory before loading the emulator, or copy all the files
from ${PREFIX}/share/adamem to your home directory (or other
desired location--like where you store your game dumps--from which you
plan on executing the emulator)...  For more info on starting and using
the emulator, ead the file:

	${PREFIX}/share/adamem/adamem.txt

4. Also, try the '-help' command line switch for a bit less detailed
guidance.

5. Enjoy!
