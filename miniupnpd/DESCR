The MiniUPnP project offers software which supports the UPnP Internet
Gateway Device (IGD) specifications. The MiniUPnP daemon (MiniUPnPd)
running on the NAT-router lets authorized computers behind NAT request
for public port redirections using UPnP or NAT-PMP protocols.  Any
peer to peer network application such as games, IM, etc. can benefit
from a NAT router supporting UPnP and/or NAT-PMP. MiniUPnPd supports
OpenBSD, FreeBSD, NetBSD and (Open)Solaris in combination with pf or
ipf and Linux with netfilter.
