# The patches have replaced old hardcoded paths with fixed cookies @PREFIX@

# Just setting BUILD_DIRS would be adequate if qcad could be built with
# "prepare all" in each module, one by one.  But qcad needs all modules to
# be prepare'd before any can be all'd, so prepare them here in a separate
# loop duplicated from do-build.  The unmodified do-build then takes care
# of the "all".  I didn't see an easier way.
