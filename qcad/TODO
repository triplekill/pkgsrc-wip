$NetBSD$

I think this package is essentially done, but it's my learn-pkgsrc package
so it's possible there are better ways to do things.  Think of this TODO
as my unanswered-questions file; I'd be happy to hear of better approaches.

This passed pkglint just fine until I factored out Makefile.common ... but
I see the qt3 stuff is factored the same way (and also annoys pkglint).
I assume that means it's ok....

QMAKESPEC is set unconditionally to netbsd-g++ but is this really the
right thing to do for a portable pkgsrc?  Is there a good way to get it
set dynamically?  Can the Qt makefiles arrange it?

The whole post-patch, er, I mean, post-wrapper target is just to arrange
to patch some fixed paths in sourcefiles to the dynamically determined
values.  Surely this comes up often enough there's just a way to say I want
these tokens changed in these files, like the way interpreters are
handled?  I didn't find one....

I have left tech-pkg@NetBSD.org as the maintainer because I am hoping to
rework shells/ast-ksh (and probably will set myself as maintainer for that
one, if nobody objects), but I made this QCad package only because I wanted
to run QCad :) and probably shouldn't take on maintainership of it long term.
