also consider other word lists like
 or ftp://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/aspell/aspell-en-0.51-0.tar.bz2
 or SCOWL from  http://wordlist.sourceforge.net/

or NetBSD's word list has 234964 words

should this have:
.if exists(/usr/share/dict/words)
PKG_FAIL_REASON=	"Your platform already has the word list installed."
.endif
I don't think so, because when installed to /usr/pkg there is no conflict.

should this be called linux-words?
an idea would be to just install linux.words file
and then have a pkgsrc option to choose which package makes symlink for words
