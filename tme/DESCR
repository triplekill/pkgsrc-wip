The Machine Emulator, or tme, is a program that provides a general-
purpose framework for computer emulation.  New in this package,
Sparc Ultra1 can be emulated when compiled when debug is turned on.
In addition, this package has been updated to GTK3, and includes a new
tap element with automatic NAT configuration with NPF, if available.
