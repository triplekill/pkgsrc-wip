The Machine Emulator, or tme, is a program that provides a general-
purpose framework for computer emulation.  This is a fork of the original,
with all applicable patches rolled in.  New in this release, the graphical
display is updated to GTK3, and a new tap element is introduced with
automatic NAT configuration using NPF or an equavalent packet filter.
