TME loads a number of shared libraries at runtime. By default it
looks for them in ${PREFIX}/lib.

Set the TME_MODULE_PATH environment variable to override this
(multiple directories may be colon separated).

tmesh runs with enhanced privileges (cap_net_admin,cap_net_raw+ep on Linux /
setuid on *BSD).  This is required to perform low-level networking functions
like configuring network parameters or accessing raw packet sockets.  It
will promptly revoke setuid after it's used, as that is also required
to run GTK3.

By default, if a tap element is instantiated, tmesh will try to create
packet filtering rules to perform outgoing NAT from it, to the external
interface specified with the "nat" option.  You can disable it by specifying
a non-existent interface (e.g., "none" should work on most platforms).
