* perl is required, so you should add USE_BUILDLINK
  and the perl5 buildlink too.
* patch-aa, USE_GMAKE and MAKE_ENV are superfluous, use simple do-install
  target instead (e.g., ${INSTALL_SCRIPT} ${WRKSRC}/*.pl ${PREFIX}/bin),
  define NO_BUILD, since no compiling is needed
* whitespace and style nits: after .include there is a space not tab,
  no / after ${WRKDIR} needed, add net to CATEGORIES, we prefer YES to yes,
  alternatively set USE_PERL5 to run so it's clear what it needs perl for.
