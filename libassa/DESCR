libASSA is an object-oriented C++ networking library based on Adaptive
Communication Patterns. It features a simplistic implementation of the
set of communication patterns such as Service Configurator, Reactor,
Acceptor, Connector, and others described in various papers published by
Dr. D. C. Schmidt. For details see at http://www.cs.wustl.edu/~schmidt/ACE.html.

libASSA happily co-exists with other frameworks such as GUI toolkits
and various CORBA implementations.
