With SMB for Fuse you can seamlessly browse your network
neighbourhood as were it on your own filesystem.

It's basically smbmount with a twist. Instead of mounting
one Samba share at a time, you mount all workgroups, hosts
and shares at once. Only when you're accessing a share a
connection is made to the remote computer.
