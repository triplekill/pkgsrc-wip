libic - Image compositing library

libic is a generic image compositing library. libic provides
Porter/Duff compositing of images and implicit mask generation for
geometric primitives including trapezoids, triangles, and rectangles.

The semantics of libic are designed to precisely match the
specification of the X Render extension. In fact, the initial
implementation of libic was lifted from the reference implementation
of RENDER from the X server.

However, libic is intended to be useful independent of the X Window
System. The public interface exported by libic does not contain any
X-specific data structures.

Keith Packard (keithp@keithp.com) originally wrote all the original
RENDER code that was yanked out to become libic. Keith also provided
impetus and guidance in the development of libic.
