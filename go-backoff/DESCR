This is a Go port of the exponential backoff algorithm from
google-http-java-client.

Exponential backoff is an algorithm that uses feedback to multiplicatively
decrease the rate of some process, in order to gradually find an acceptable
rate. The retries exponentially increase and stop increasing when a certain
threshold is met.
