The MySQL directory `${MYSQL_DATADIR}' should be owned by the
user `${MYSQL_USER}' and group `${MYSQL_GROUP}'.  This can be done with:
	chown -R ${MYSQL_USER}:${MYSQL_GROUP} ${MYSQL_DATADIR}


If this is a new installation, please remember to set a password for
the MySQL root user!  This is done by running both:
	${PREFIX}/bin/mysqladmin -u root -p password 'new-password'
	${PREFIX}/bin/mysqladmin -h `hostname` -u root -p password 'new-password'
(The "Enter password:" prompt is asking for the existing password. 
As there is no existing password, just press Return.)

See the manual for more instructions.
