pkglint warns:
WARN: use of DISTFILES with single file discouraged. distribution filename should be set by DISTNAME and EXTRACT_SUFX.
WARN: do not use DISTFILES and DISTNAME to control WRKSRC. how about "WRKSRC=${WRKDIR}/lletters-0.1.9"?

sometimes lletters hangs

maybe wavr should be made into a seperate package (for wavtools)
