$NetBSD$

You can run the X11 UnNetHack by typing
"NETHACKOPTIONS=windowtype:x11 nethack" or by putting that option in
your ~/.unnethackrc file. Other windowtypes are curses and tty.

Two fonts were installed for NetHack.  You must add
${PREFIX}/lib/X11/fonts/misc to fontpath and set one of

NetHack*map*font: nh10
NetHack*map*font: -misc-fixed-medium-r-normal-ibmpc-14-120-75-75-c-80-iso8859-1

in ${PREFIX}/share/unnethackdir510/UnNetHack.ad to use it.
Tiled mode is enabled by:

NetHack.tile_file: x11tiles

Also see ${PREFIX}/share/unnethackdir510/nethack.x11.rc for inspiration.

Note that the X11 version is prone to crashing!
