wkf stands for "WALL's Kanji Filter," and it's a program used to
convert between various encodings used for Japanese character sets. It
handles ISO-2022-JP, Shift_JIS, EUC-JP. As well, it can do MIME decoding.
It also can try to guess the input encoding so that you don't have to
specify it and you can use it just to determine encoding.
Not only program but also include C API for Kanji code converter,
base64/quoted-printable encoder/decoder.
