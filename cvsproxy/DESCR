The cvsproxy is a relay server for the cvs pserver protocol.
It works on UNIX derived systems, running as a child process of inetd.

To use cvsproxy, you don't have to update or change your cvs client.
Suppose that the remote repository name is:

    :pserver:me@cvs.example.org:/cvsroot

and that cvsproxy is running on the host `relay'.
To use cvsproxy, tell your cvs client the repository name is:

    :pserver:me%cvs.example.org@relay:/cvsroot

When your client accesses the repository,
it establishes a connection with `relay',
instead of `cvs.example.org'. cvsproxy
running on `relay' forwards the connection to `cvs.example.org',
so that it behaves as the cvs server on `cvs.example.org' toward your client.
