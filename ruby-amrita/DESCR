Amrita is an html/xhtml template library for Ruby
 It makes html documents from a template and model data.

Key features:

	* The template for amrita is a pure html/xhtml document without
		special tags like <?...?> or <% .. %>
	* The template can be written by designers using almost any html editor.
	* There's no need to change Ruby code to modify the view of the
		_dynamic_ part of the template (or the static portion).
	* The model data may be any standard Ruby data-- a Hash, Array,
		 String... or an instance of any user-defined class.
	* The output is controlled by _data_, not by logic-- so it's easy to
		write, test, and debug code. (Good for eXtremeProgramming)
	* The html template can be compiled into Ruby code before execution
		with little effort.

Amrita uses a template and model data to create an html document by
naturally matching the +id+ attribute of an html element to model data.
