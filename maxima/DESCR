Maxima is a descendant of DOE Macsyma, which had its origins in the late
1960s at MIT. It is the only system based on that effort still publicly
available and with an active user community, thanks to its open source
nature. Macsyma was the first of a new breed of computer algebra systems,
leading the way for programs such as Maple and Mathematica. This particular
variant of Macsyma was maintained by William Schelter from 1982 until he
passed away in 2001. In 1998 he obtained permission to release the source
code under GPL. It was his efforts and skill which have made the survival of
Maxima possible, and we are very grateful to him for volunteering his time
and skill to keep the original Macsyma code alive and well. Since his
passing a group of users and developers has formed to keep Maxima alive and
kicking. Maxima itself is reasonably feature complete at this stage, with
abilities such as symbolic integration, 3D plotting, and an ODE solver, but
there is a lot of work yet to be done in terms of bug fixing, cleanup, and
documentation. This is not to say there will be no new features, but there
is much work to be done before that stage will be reached, and for now new
features are not likely to be our focus.
