1) Patch man page for paths (use sed in pre-install)
	I really don't know how to do this. I looked at pkgsrc/mk/subst.mk,
	but I still don't understand it.

2) Still waiting for Lutz to `make man' before packaging this release.
	The Makefile has a commented entry for now,
	just so this pkg can be installed.
