1) Install example configuration. Look in contrib/ directory.

	Been done for awhile. This release was supposed to have
	the NetBSD config file at http://othyro.freeshell.org/prngd.conf,
	but for some reason, Lutz neglected to include it in this release.

2) Have MESSAGE about entropy.

	Done. Maybe the word-smiths would want to tweak it up.

3) Is this okay? RANDSAVENAME="/var/db/prngd-seed"
	
	Some say that's okay. Maybe use BUILD_DEFS if necessary.

4) Patch man page for paths (use sed in pre-install)
	I really don't know how to do this. I looked at pkgsrc/mk/subst.mk, but I still don't understand it.

5) The prngd.pod doesn't get converted to prngd.man as in the previous version 0.9.27, so the install of
	prngd-0.9.28 breaks. It does, however, build fine, as did 0.9.27.
