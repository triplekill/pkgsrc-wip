ILE is an acronym for I Love Email, which is just an indicator of
how good I am for choosing project names. The purpose of the
component is to notify you when new email has arrived to your
account, which you can configure when you register with ILE.

The current set of features, as of version 0.4, include:
    * Check email from POP or IMAP email accounts, configurable at the
      client side.
    * Disallow notification when in Extended Away or DND status.
    * Configurable email checking periods, at the server side.
    * i18n support, configurable at the server side. (en, es, ca, ro, nl)
    * Allow to specify a webmail URL so that notifications can point
      your browser to the webmail gateway.
