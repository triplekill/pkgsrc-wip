This conflicts with mit-krb5 and heimdal (but didn't add CONFLICTS 
yet because I need both).  Need to figure out a way to split out
bin/compile_et, lib/libcom_err.a, and compile_et.1.

use libtool to properly build so executables are linked correctly
/usr/pkg/sbin/debugfs:
         -lext2fs.2 => not found
         -le2p.2 => not found
         -lss.2 => not found
         -lcom_err.2 => not found
         -lblkid.1 => not found
         -luuid.1 => not found
         -lc.12 => /usr/lib/libc.so.12

As libuuid is available as separate package in pkgsrc-wip, make it neither
build nor install its own libuuid.
