This is a try at a Bugzilla package but there are a few things to
be aware of:

- It's not complete yet as it provides the user with no instruction on how
  to setup the mySQL side of Bugzilla.
- I'm not a Bugzilla person so I'm not sure if the application defaults
  are appropriate or should be changed.
- You need to install the p5-Chart pkg which is in pkgsrc-wip as well.
  However, I have not tested that it actually works with Bugzilla.

If anyone feels they want to give it a go and can test it adequately please 
feel free to hack away at it.

Sort of tested on NetBSD 1.6 i386.

Regards,

Adrian.
