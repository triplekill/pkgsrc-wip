The 'gnome-main-menu' is a set of three  utilities, a mate-panel applet
similar to the traditional main-menu, but with a few additions:

  * it does  not provide  direct access to all the applications on the
    system, but rather  displays user specified 'favorites' and recent
    launched applications[1].

  * access to  all the  applications is made  through the  application
    browser, a larger format application than main-menu managed by the
    window manager to allow resizing, etc.

  * the final utility is gnome-control-center which is laid out exactly
    as the application browser, but providing access to all the system
    configuration utilties.

Both the application-browser and the gnome-control-center are accesible
directly from the main-menu.

As from 28th  November 2012 this component is maintained for usage with
the MATE Desktop, see http://www.mate-desktop.org.
