Steel Bank Common Lisp (SBCL) is an Open Source complier and runtime
system for ANSI Common Lisp.  It provides an interactive environment
including an integrated native compiler, a debugger, and many
extensions.

This version is meant to be used as intermediate stage while
bootstrapping SBCL using CLISP.
