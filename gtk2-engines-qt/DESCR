This GTK theme engine uses the currently selected QT style to do its
drawing. Basically, it makes your GTK apps look like QT ones :)

Currently the code is very buggy and incomplete - a few widgets do not yet
use the QT drawing code. However it is still perfectly usable. This theme is
slightly slower than that of most native GTK themes, but the difference is
hardly noticed on a fast machine.

Known bugs:
* Colours are incorrect when using certain styles (eg. Keramik)
* Buttons, and other widgets, may be the wrong size
* Scrollbars sometimes misbehave

This is a 0.x release - do don't expect it to work perfectly :)
