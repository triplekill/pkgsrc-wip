cryptoIDlib is a python library and command-line tools for working with cryptoID
certificate chains. Among other things, it provides client and server
implementations of the cryptoID key management protocols.

cryptoIDlib's sister library is TLS Lite. TLS Lite is necessary if you want to
use the key management protocols. Also, if you have TLS Lite and cryptoIDlib,
you can use cryptoIDs to authenticate in TLS.
