teTeX was a comprehensive distribution of TeX, LaTeX and
family, particularly designed to be very easy to install and to
customise. In 2006, Thomas Esser announced he would no longer
be able to support, or to produce new versions of, teTeX. With
the appearance of TeX-live 2007 (whose Unix-system TeX support
originally derived from teTeX), no-one should be using teTeX at
all, in new applications.
