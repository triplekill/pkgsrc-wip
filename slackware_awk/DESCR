gawk (pattern scanning and processing language)

Gawk is the GNU Project's implementation of the AWK programming
language.  It conforms to the definition of the language in the POSIX
1003.2 Command Language And Utilities Standard.  This version in turn
is based on the description in The AWK Programming Language, by Aho,
Kernighan, and Weinberger, with the additional features found in the
System V Release 4 version of UNIX awk.  Gawk also provides more
recent Bell Labs awk extensions, and some GNU-specific extensions.
