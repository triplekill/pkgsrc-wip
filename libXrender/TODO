This package is the same code as x11/Xrender.

The main differences are that its uses other freedesktop.org xlib
code as dependencies and does not use USE_X11. (This means that
it doesn't need complete XFree86 to build.)

A problem is that regular x11/Xrender installs to the same place.
This will overwrite parts of x11/Xrender's files.

This needs to be fixed so the correct version of "Xrender"
is used depending on the setup.
