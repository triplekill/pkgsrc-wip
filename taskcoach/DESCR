Task Coach is a simple open source todo manager to keep track of
personal tasks and todo lists. It grew out of a frustration that
most task managers do not provide facilities for composite tasks.
Often, tasks and other things todo consist of several activities.
Task Coach is designed to deal with composite tasks. In addition,
it offers effort tracking, categories, and notes.
