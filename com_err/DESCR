This package is the Common Error Description Library for UNIX.
This library and associated utilities provides an uniform way for
libraries to return errors to their callers, and for programs to
describe errors and exceptional conditions to their users.

This package provides the common error display routine library,
com_err(3), and error table compiler, compile_et(1).

This version of the com_err library is maintained by Theodore Ts'o
and is included with the e2fsprogs code.  It includes krb5 and
Heimdal compatibility functions and compile_et extensions.
