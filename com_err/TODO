what should the package version number be?

what should the homepage be?

should get security/heimdal, kth-krb4, and wip/mit-krb5 to use this
or at least don't have conflicting files.
(I already did wip/e2fsprogs, but need to commit once lock is fixed.)

maybe make run tex on the com_err.texinfo file to provide a
plain text version to put under share/doc/com_err/README

compile_et contains:
ET_DIR="/usr/obj/wip/com_err/work.i386/e2fsprogs-1.35/lib/et"
what should be there instead?
