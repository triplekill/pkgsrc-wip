- Builds and does not crash on NetBSD/i386 3.1.
- Does not extract text correctly from phototest.tif.
  Maybe this is related to the many warnings about sign mismatches or the missing
  virtual destructors?


- Is this still true? According to "ChangeLog" fixes for 64-bit systems were added.
Compiles fine, but dumps core on NetBSD-4.99.3/amd64. Backtrace:
