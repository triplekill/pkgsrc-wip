(The following is current as of opensc-0.13.0git20140221130957.)

This is a newer version of security/opensc (a recent snapshot from the
upstream Git repository).  Only minimal changes to opensc-0.12.2 have
been made to get it to build; some of the contents of the Makefile may
no longer be necessary (e.g., CONFIGURE_ARGS, CONFIGURE_ENV,
dependencies) and new settings/dependencies may be required.  No
testing has been done, other than to ensure that it builds on NetBSD
6.1 i386.

TODO:
  * basic testing
  * prune obsolete dependencies and settings from Makefile, if any
  * prune obsolete patches, if any
  * add new dependencies, if any
  * verify that options.mk is still appropriate
