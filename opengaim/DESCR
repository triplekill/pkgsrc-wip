OpenGaim is an instant messaging, or "text chat", client capable of
communicating over many protocols, including Jabber, AOL Instant Messenger
(AIM), ICQ, MSN Messenger, Yahoo! Messenger, Internet Relay Chat (IRC), and
more. It runs on Microsoft Windows and the Unix-based X Window System, using
the GTK2 GUI toolkit.

OpenGaim is a loose relative of the Gaim project and contains much of the
source code in Gaim itself. However, OpenGaim aims to provide quicker
releases to fix major problems, and advanced customization options and
features not available in Gaim.
