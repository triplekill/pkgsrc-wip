Note on fortran
---------------

- for pkgsrc-2010Q2 and older you need to use::

    USE_LANGUAGES=  c c++ fortran

  instead of::

    USE_LANGUAGES=  c c++ fortran77

  as that option changed only in August 2010

Build Success
-------------

- NetBSD 5.1_RC3 / amd64 / pkgsrc-2010Q2

Build Failures
--------------

- NetBSD 5.0.1 / i386 / pkgsr-2010Q2

  It seems that it failed because I already had GraphicsMagick installed and configure found it (but Magick++.h was missing)
