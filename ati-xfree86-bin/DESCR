This package installs the AMD/ATI Linux binary driver in a manner
suitable for use on NetBSD/i386 with XFree86 4.3 and above.
This driver enables dual-head support (with or without Xinerama).
This package does not enable accelerated GL support, nor DRI support.

This package installs what is deemed to be a stable version of the
driver, which may not correspond to the latest version released by
ATI.  The latest ATI driver, which may be not as tested and thus
less stable, may be available as ati-xfree86-bin-unstable.
