This package installs the AMD/ATI Linux binary driver in a manner
suitable for use on NetBSD/i386 with XFree86 4.3 and above.
This driver provides dual-head support (with or without Xinerama).
This package does not enable accelerated GL support.

Note: some machines may require using `initati' from wip/ati-xfree86-bin-init
to work-around an initialization issue that may lead to a complete hang.
