Firewall Builder consists of an object-oriented GUI and a set of policy
compilers for various firewall platforms. In Firewall Builder, a firewall
policy is a set of rules; each rule consists of abstract objects that
represent real network objects and services (hosts, routers, firewalls,
networks, protocols). Firewall Builder helps users maintain a database of
objects and allows policy editing using simple drag-and-drop operations.
