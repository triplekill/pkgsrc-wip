The OSSP lmtp2nntp program is an LMTP service for use in conjunction with a Mail
Transfer Agent (MTA) like Sendmail or Postfix, providing a reliable real-time
mail to news gateway. Input messages get their headers slightly reformatted to
match Usenet news article format. The article is then posted or feeded into a
remote NNTP service (like INN). Delivery must take place immediately or the
transaction fails. OSSP lmtp2nntp relies on the queueing capabilities of the MTA
in order to provide a fully reliable service. For this the program returns
proper delivery status notification which indicates successful completed action,
persistent transient failure or permanent failure.
