Two issues on NetBSD:
a) hangs on 6.99.6/amd64 during the setup step
b) I read it needs inotify support, so making it upload will probably be hard;
   it might auto-download though

One general issue:
It complains about the non-standard installation location.
I think the only problem that this could cause is if it wants to
write in its own directory. I don't know if it does though.
If it does, I suggest removing the package, since there's no point...
