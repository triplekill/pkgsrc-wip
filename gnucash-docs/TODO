Update to 1.8.4.

should PLIST include
share/omf
share/gnome/help

should this depend on gnom2-dirs?
DEPENDS+=      gnome2-dirs>=1.2:../../misc/gnome2-dirs

I patched configure (but not configure.in) to use
db3. Maybe this should allow db4 or db3.

This installs xml and html files; maybe html files should
be installed to different location.

There are error messages with "de" localization. Not tested.

The post-build target is so it is done as regular user (because
"make clean" won't work later because of root ownership). Maybe
umask will work. But the "install" target does do the xsltproc
again (but still can be deleted).

Maybe remove reference to Yelp in DESCR.
