PaPy is a framework to construct and execute pipelines (flow-charts) of
arbitrary tasks in parallel, either locally, using multi-processing or
multi-threading, or remotely, using RPC (Remote Procedure Calls) as provided by
RPyC (Remote Python Call). The goal is to enable users to create highly generic,
modular and workflows for execution on ad hoc  computing grids, consisting of,
local workstations and remote desktops/servers.
