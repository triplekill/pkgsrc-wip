misen is the text template library like Amrita.

misen generates text document from a template and a model data
('template expansion'). The difference to Amrita is:

 * Not only HTML/XML, you can use it with any type of text.
 * You can customize rules of parsing and formatting by implementing 'style'.
 * Simpler architecture and faster.
