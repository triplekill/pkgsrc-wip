2014-06-10 Added Colorbar.remove()

2014-06-07 Fixed bug so radial plots can be saved as ps in py3k.

2014-06-01 Changed the fmt kwarg of errorbar to support the
           the mpl convention that "none" means "don't draw it",
           and to default to the empty string, so that plotting
           of data points is done with the plot() function
           defaults.  Deprecated use of the None object in place
           "none".

2014-05-22 Allow the linscale keyword parameter of symlog scale to be
           smaller than one.

2014-05-20 Added logic to in FontManager to invalidate font-cache if
           if font-family rcparams have changed.

2014-05-16 Fixed the positioning of multi-line text in the PGF backend.

2014-05-14 Added Axes.add_image() as the standard way to add AxesImage
           instances to Axes. This improves the consistency with
           add_artist(), add_collection(), add_container(), add_line(),
           add_patch(), and add_table().

2014-05-02 Added colorblind-friendly colormap, named 'Wistia'.

2014-04-27 Improved input clean up in Axes.{h|v}lines
           Coerce input into a 1D ndarrays (after dealing with units).

2014-04-27 removed un-needed cast to float in stem

2014-04-23 Updated references to "ipython -pylab"
           The preferred method for invoking pylab is now using the
           "%pylab" magic.
           -Chris G.

2014-04-22 Added (re-)generate a simple automatic legend to "Figure Options"
           dialog of the Qt4Agg backend.

2014-04-22 Added an example showing the difference between
           interpolation = 'none' and interpolation = 'nearest' in
           `imshow()` when saving vector graphics files.

2014-04-22 Added violin plotting functions. See `Axes.violinplot`,
           `Axes.violin`, `cbook.violin_stats` and `mlab.GaussianKDE` for
           details.

2014-04-10 Fixed the triangular marker rendering error. The "Up" triangle was
           rendered instead of "Right" triangle and vice-versa.

2014-04-08 Fixed a bug in parasite_axes.py by making a list out
           of a generator at line 263.

2014-04-02 Added `clipon=False` to patch creation of wedges and shadows
	   in `pie`.

2014-02-25 In backend_qt4agg changed from using update -> repaint under
           windows.  See comment in source near `self._priv_update` for
           longer explaination.

2014-03-27 Added tests for pie ccw parameter. Removed pdf and svg images
           from tests for pie linewidth parameter.

2014-03-24 Changed the behaviour of axes to not ignore leading or trailing
           patches of height 0 (or width 0) while calculating the x and y
           axis limits. Patches having both height == 0 and width == 0 are
           ignored.

2014-03-24 Added bool kwarg (manage_xticks) to boxplot to enable/disable
           the managemnet of the xlimits and ticks when making a boxplot.
           Default in True which maintains current behavior by default.

2014-03-23 Fixed a bug in projections/polar.py by making sure that the theta
           value being calculated when given the mouse coordinates stays within
           the range of 0 and 2 * pi.

2014-03-22 Added the keyword arguments wedgeprops and textprops to pie.
           Users can control the wedge and text properties of the pie
           in more detail, if they choose.

2014-03-17 Bug was fixed in append_axes from the AxesDivider class would not
           append axes in the right location with respect to the reference
           locator axes

2014-03-13 Add parameter 'clockwise' to function pie, True by default.

2014-02-28 Added 'origin' kwarg to `spy`

2014-02-27 Implemented separate horizontal/vertical axes padding to the
           ImageGrid in the AxesGrid toolkit

2014-02-27 Allowed markevery property of matplotlib.lines.Line2D to be, an int
           numpy fancy index, slice object, or float.  The float behaviour
           turns on markers at approximately equal display-coordinate-distances
           along the line.

2014-02-25 In backend_qt4agg changed from using update -> repaint under
           windows.  See comment in source near `self._priv_update` for
           longer explaination.

2014-01-02 `triplot` now returns the artist it adds and support of line and
           marker kwargs has been improved. GBY

2013-12-30 Made streamplot grid size consistent for different types of density
           argument. A 30x30 grid is now used for both density=1 and
           density=(1, 1).

2013-12-03 Added a pure boxplot-drawing method that allow a more complete
           customization of boxplots. It takes a list of dicts contains stats.
           Also created a function (`cbook.boxplot_stats`) that generates the
           stats needed.

2013-11-28 Added qhull extension module to perform Delaunay triangulation more
           robustly than before.  It is used by tri.Triangulation (and hence
           all pyplot.tri* methods) and mlab.griddata.  Deprecated
           matplotlib.delaunay module. - IMT

2013-11-05 Add power-law normalization method. This is useful for,
           e.g., showing small populations in a "hist2d" histogram.

2013-10-27 Added get_rlabel_position and set_rlabel_position methods to
           PolarAxes to control angular position of radial tick labels.

2013-10-06 Add stride-based functions to mlab for easy creation of 2D arrays
           with less memory.

2013-10-06 Improve window and detrend functions in mlab, particulart support for
           2D arrays.

2013-10-06 Improve performance of all spectrum-related mlab functions and plots.

2013-10-06 Added support for magnitude, phase, and angle spectrums to
           axes.specgram, and support for magnitude, phase, angle, and complex
           spectrums to mlab-specgram.

2013-10-06 Added magnitude_spectrum, angle_spectrum, and phase_spectrum plots,
           as well as magnitude_spectrum, angle_spectrum, phase_spectrum,
           and complex_spectrum functions to mlab

2013-07-12 Added support for datetime axes to 2d plots. Axis values are passed
           through Axes.convert_xunits/Axes.convert_yunits before being used by
           contour/contourf, pcolormesh and pcolor.

2013-07-12 Allowed matplotlib.dates.date2num, matplotlib.dates.num2date,
           and matplotlib.dates.datestr2num to accept n-d inputs. Also
           factored in support for n-d arrays to matplotlib.dates.DateConverter
           and matplotlib.units.Registry.

2013-06-26 Refactored the axes module: the axes module is now a folder,
           containing the following submodule:
              - _subplots.py, containing all the subplots helper methods
              - _base.py, containing several private methods and a new
                _AxesBase class. This _AxesBase class contains all the methods
                that are not directly linked to plots of the "old" Axes
              - _axes.py contains the Axes class. This class now inherits from
                _AxesBase: it contains all "plotting" methods and labelling
                methods.
           This refactoring should not affect the API. Only private methods
           are not importable from the axes module anymore.
