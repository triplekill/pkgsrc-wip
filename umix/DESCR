Umix is a program for adjusting soundcard volumes and other
features in soundcard mixers. You can control your volumes, balances 
and recording sources flexibly from the command line, with a ncurses 
user interface with familiar vi/emacs keybindings or with a GTK+2 
graphical UI. Umix supports multiple mixer devices and all mixer 
drivers and UI's are dynamically loaded at runtime as plugins. All 
settings can be saved and loaded from a file.
