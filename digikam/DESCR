digiKam is an advanced digital photo management application for
KDE, which makes importing and organizing digital photos a "snap".
The photos are organized in albums which can be sorted chronologically,
by folder layout or by custom collections.

Tired of the folder constraints? Don't worry, digiKam also provides
tagging. You tag your images which can be spread out across multiple
folders, and digiKam provides fast and intuitive ways to browse
these tagged images. You can also add comments to your images.
digiKam makes use of a fast and robust database to store these
meta-informations which makes adding and editing of comments and
tags very reliable.

digiKam makes use of KIPI plugins for lots of added functionality.
KIPI (KDE Image Plugin Interface) is an initiative to create a
common plugin infrastructure for digiKam, KPhotoAlbum, Showimg,
and GwenView. Its aim is to allow development of image plugins
which can be shared among KDE graphical applications.

An easy-to-use interface is provided that enables you to connect
to your camera and preview, download and/or delete your images.
Basic auto-transformations can be deployed on the fly during image
downloading.

Another tool, which most artists and photographers will be familiar
with, is a Light Table. This tool assists artists and photographers
with reviewing their work ensuring the highest quality only. A
classical light table will show the artist the place on the images
to touch up. Well in digiKam, the light table function provides
the user a similar experience. You can import a photo, drag it onto
the light table, and touch up only the areas that need it.

The digiKam Image Editor has its own plugin subsystem with some
common tools e.g. red eye correction or Gamma correction. Additional
plugins are provided with the main application to process advanced
corrections on image like color management, noise reduction, or
special effects. digiKam Image Editor supports all camera RAW file
formats, 16 bits color depth, Exif/Makernote/IPTC/GPS metadata,
Color management, tagging/rating/comments pictures, etc.

A stand-alone image editor version named ShowFoto is also available.
It runs without digiKam images database support, but provides all
Image Editor functions.
