Fvwm is a very famous window manager for X, which provides a
virtual/multiple disjoint desktop, a 3-D look for windows decorations,
shaped/color icons. It gives a very good emulation of mwm. A nice
button-bar can be used to provide convenient access to frequently used
functions or programs.

This is the older, smaller version of fvwm; it uses not much more
than half the memory of version 2.

Unlike the original fvwm1 this version is maintained and includes the
following changes:
- Converted the build system from imake to automake (Tonnerre)

The following revision is going to have Xinerama support among other things.
